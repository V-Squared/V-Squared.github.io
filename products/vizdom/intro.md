# Fun, Inspiring, Memorable

Comics are fun.\\
Textbooks are dry,\\
causing lessons you learned,\\
to pass you by.\\
You want to know …
{: class="poem"}

## Why?

**Remember Solutions When Needed:** Ever read a great self-help book that made sense, yet later you could not remember nor apply the life changing fixes when you needed them the most? It's because your brain has evolved to remember stories and pictures. Traditional textbooks are not written in that way.

That's why we wrote our **life-hacks with the secret sauce of humorous illustrated anecdotes.** The anecdotes are designed with many details to trigger your brain's memorization process. Such as a consistent cast of characters who experience problems similar to those that you want to solve. And they do so with humor and a punch line.

This is a good moment to introduce our central character, the Phoenix:

**Crash:** Ever feel as if your life is going down in flames? It happens to all of us!
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comics/intro/phoenix-recovery.jpg)

**Recovery:** You may already have guessed why we picked the Phoenix. It is a symbol of what matters most in life: How you get back onto your feet. Find inspiration in the adventures of the Phoenix. A kindred soul, who always rises from the ashes and goes on to build a better life.

When you are reading a self-help book you want be inspired to create new solutions that solve your specific problems. When doing so you want to both memorize these solutions and to install a trigger, so that when you are in actual trouble the solution will automatically come to you, just when you need it. ViZdom will show you how to do that. **That's why and how ViZdom\* is more powerful than mere knowledge!**  \*(rhymes with wisdom)

This is a bold statement. You may not be able to confirm this now. But when you read on you may find quite quickly, that reading this book is more fun. Fun will make you read more, and come back more often. So you already know that you will have better retention.

## Why Very Structured?

There are four strong reasons: 1) Memorization 2) Understanding 3) Speed Reading 4) Navigation. Let's look at them one at a time:

**Memorization:** This is a lot of content. To really make it useful for you, you will have to remember it. You will learn later (in Brain OS 4.0) that forgetting is not a bug, but a filtering feature of your Brain Operating System. So, to convince your brain to memorize, you need to repeat. Reading the entire book many times is completely impractical. Instead, the clear structure allows you to quickly identify passages that you care about and subsequently speed-read them. There is more to say about this topic, but for the sake of introduction we hope you get the gist of it.

**Understanding:** Structured writing slices the information into smaller, easier to digest pieces. When struggling with comprehension, you only need to re-read the slice that is causing you trouble.

**Speed Reading:** We have highlighted the most salient point of each paragraph, making it easy to identify them when skimming.

**Navigation & Reference:** This is a lot of content. You may want to refer to it. The clear structure, in conjunction with lots of visual elements, makes it easier to quickly find what you are looking for.

## The Secret Sauce
Let's have a look at ViZdom-style anecdotes. We are starting off with a simple one. Simple as in this anecdote works stand alone. We use it in the life-hack of increasing discipline. It illuminates the aspect that not all your attempts will work instantly. Hence, it is important that you develop persistence and keep on trying. Without further ado, here goes:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comics/intro/never-give-up.png)

Almost every problem has a solution, but it may be difficult to envision. It often takes persistence, creativity, observational skills, and a willingness to think outside of the box to find your path to success.

Moving on to a more complex example:
{:.text-center}

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comics/intro/premature-discipline.png)

**We all have our internal pig-dog, who always tries to seduce us.** Who overpromises, who wants to cut corners, to party, to slack. When we give in, work does not get done, quality goes down. Self-discipline provides the counterforce in our struggle for a healthy balance of fun vs. work.

But if you commit to a project which requires more self-discipline than you currently possess, your internal pig-dog will win and you won't deliver as you promised. Trouble and disappointment will ensue, followed by lost trust. Instead, **learn to judge your self-discipline correctly so you don't bite off more than you can chew.** Or learn how to increase your self-discipline so you can complete bigger projects successfully in less time.

**You may also find more peace if you stop fighting your internal pig-dog.** It is a part of you. Instead, see it as a resource. E.g., consult with your internal pig-dog when planning your next party. Try to love and respect it for its continuous capacity for fun, and  simply counter its influence with self-discipline!

---

As you may have guessed, this anecdote alone won't cure your problem of lack of self-discipline (in case you have one). But it will serve to foster a deeper understanding of the ramifications of a lack of self-discipline. Hence, this anecdote is used in conjunction with other anecdotes, short stories, diagrams and tools to address the issue completely.

**At the end of this introduction we will show you how it is done in one complete life-hack.** For now, I hope you can glean that illustrated anecdotes are able to illuminate one aspect at a time, and they do so by being fun, insightful and memorable.

The strategy of addressing larger issues, by combining several anecdotes, has the dramatic benefit of being more fun and memorable than traditional large monolithic textbook style.

# Real Characters

The one thing that is even more memorable than life-hacks in illustrated anecdotes, are illustrated anecdotes made up of a **consistent cast of characters.** And how better to visualize your own character improvements than by following along the **characters' development in story arcs.** With no further ado, we introduce you to …

## Inspirations R Us

It started innocently enough. We had issues in our team and with ourselves, and started to fix them. Interesting stories ensued. Bobby sketched them out as comics for our own amusement. Kind of to soften the harshness of fixing our flaws. Violet shared them on WeChat. Suddenly we had followers who wanted more. After we got over the shock of laying our souls bare for everyone to nitpick, we kind of liked it, too.

## Eating our Own Dogfood

Meaning, we compiled and developed all these life hacks to fix our own lives. We faced and fixed Asperger, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, failing marriage, depression, nihilism, frustrated teams, and angry teenagers to name just a few … We can't guarantee that what worked for us will work for you. But we can guarantee that we used every single life-hack on ourselves and that it did work! When life throws us a curveball today, we now can react with grace and efficiency, rather than with terror and panic.

## Why we Care to Share

This project is really not the first time we tried to fix ourselves. In each previous attempt we read and applied a new self-help book with passion. Sadly with limited success. This time we dared to develop our own approach. And it worked. We were extremely surprised by just how effective our new approach was! Being blessed with such a success, we felt an urge not to keep it for ourselves. This is our attempt of sharing our stories as we lived them(\*), hoping they will work for you, too. We even made it an Open Source community project on GitHub. More about it below.

(\*) Not all ideas in our stories are our creations. Like everybody else we live on shoulders of giants, being blessed with inspirations of those who came before us and who were kind enough to share their insights. We are particularly grateful to all self-help book authors. They had great ideas on what to change. Please see → ViZdom.Inspiration. However, we needed to find a way on how to apply these changes.

# Gifted by ViZdom

## A True story
My son composed, arranged, played all instruments, audio engineered, and produced a film score only 3 months after he began to learn about music and how to play instruments. When playing his composition for others, we heard comments like: "Lukas has so much talent!", "He is a genius!", or "He is gifted!". I truly believe that he is gifted. But not in the way you may think, as in gifted with amazing genes. In fact, I think my genes are quite average. Which is a good thing! I also believe (and history has proven) that genius can stem from average heritage. In the words of Goethe – "Every child is born a genius". And one way to produce a genius is by being gifted with ViZdom.

## You can be Gifted Too!
Being educated in ViZdom has prepared Lukas to learn the essence of making music much faster. The same way ViZdom helped him to become a 3D designer, a web programmer, or a musician. All my life I have helped people who were stuck in average jobs producing unnoticeable work to go on and deliver stunning art. It is our dream to give you the hope that you can do the same. We are aiming to write ViZdom clearly enough to inspire you to realize your potential and how to unlock it!

## ViZdom as a Gift!

If it works for you and if you love someone, consider giving them the gift of ViZdom. Starting at only 99 cents US, we did our best to make it affordable, too. At the same time, your support helps us to keep the lights on, buy rice, and to produce more ViZdom for you.

## Contributing Your 2 Cents

What we are trying to accomplish with the community project of ViZdom is to help you bring out your genius.
