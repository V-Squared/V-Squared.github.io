# Fun, Inspiring, Memorable

## Why?

**Remember Solutions When Needed:** Ever read a great self-help book and a year later you could not remember the life-changing fixes when you needed them the most? It's because your brain has evolved to remember stories and pictures. That's why we wrote our ***life-hacks in 1001 humorous anecdotes***, featuring the Phoenix experiencing adventures in the first person, paired with their own illustrations. So when you build your memories while reading ViZdom™, you can easily picture yourself in your own troubled situations. Later, when you are in actual trouble, the right life-hack will be triggered to pop up in your mind, presenting a solution getting you out of trouble! ***That's why and how ViZdom\* is more powerful than mere knowledge!  \*(rhymes with wisdom)***

## How:

### Premature Self-Discipline
<p style="text-align: center">Don't set yourself up for failure!</p>

We all have our internal-pig-dog, who always tries to seduce us: to cut corners, to party, to slack. When we give in, work does not get done, quality goes down. Self-discipline provides the counterforce in our struggle for a healthy balance of fun vs. work. But if you commit to a project which requires more self-discipline than you currently possess, your internal-pig-dog will win and you won't deliver as you promised. Trouble and disappointment will ensue, followed by lost trust. Learn how to increase your self-discipline so you can complete bigger projects successfully in less time. You may also find more peace if you stop fighting your internal-pig-dog. It is a part of you. Instead, see it as a resource. E.g. consult with your internal-pig-dog when planning your next party. Try to love and respect it for its continuous capacity for fun, and  simply counter its influence with self-discipline!

### Keep on Trying

Almost every problem has a solution, but it may be difficult to envision. It often takes persistence, creativity, observational skills, and a willingness to think outside of the box to find your path to success.

## Inspirations R Us

And this is how we look in real life.

## Why we Care to Dare

**We are People with a Makers & Hacker Spirit:** We needed a new understandings combined with illustrated skills and tricks to ease improving our lives. We wanted to get it done with the least fuss and most fun! When our friend read our internal writing they suggested this may be interesting to a wider audience.

**Eating our Own Dogfood:** Meaning, we compiled and developed all these life hacks to first fix our own lives. Being a fairly large team, we needed to face and fix or accept (reclaim the piece, with oneself and with others) Asperger, PTSD, failing marriage, depression, nihilism, frustrated teams, and angry teenagers to name just a few … We can't guarantee that what worked for us will work for you. But we can guarantee that we used every single life-hack on ourselves and that it did work! When life throws us a curveball we now can react with grace and efficiency, rather than with terror and panic.

**We are Family:** Hubba blubber blub
