# Fun, Inspiring, Memorable

Comics are fun.\\
Textbooks are dry,\\
causing lessons you learned,\\
to pass you by.\\
You want to know …
{: class="poem"}

## Why?

**Remember Solutions When Needed:** Ever read a great self-help book that made sense, yet later you could not remember nor apply the life-changing fixes when you needed them the most? It's because your brain has evolved to remember stories and pictures. Traditional textbooks are not written in that way.

That's why we wrote our **life-hacks with the secret sauce of humorous illustrated anecdotes.** The anecdotes are designed in many details so to trigger your brain's memorization process. Such as a consistent cast of characters who experience similar problems that you want to solve. And they do so with humor and a punch line.

This is a good moment to introduce the central character, the Phoenix:

**Crash:** Ever feel as if your life is going down in flames? It happens to all of us!
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comics/intro/phoenix-recovery.png)

**Recovery:** You will already have guessed why we picked the Phoenix. It is a symbol of what matters most in life: How you get back onto your feet. Find inspiration in the adventures of the Phoenix. A kindred soul, who always rises from the ashes and goes on to build a better life.

When you are reading a self-help book you want be inspired to create new custom solutions to solve your specific problems. When doing so you both want to memorize these solutions and you want to install a trigger, so that when you are in actual trouble the solution will automatically come to you, just when you need it. **That's why and how ViZdom\* is more powerful than mere knowledge!**  \*(rhymes with wisdom)

This is a bold statement. You may not be able to confirm this now. But when you read on you may find quite quickly, that reading this book is more fun. Fun will make you read more, and come back more often. So you already know that you will have a better memorization.

## Why Very Structured?

There are four strong reasons: 1) Memorization 2) Understanding 3) Speed Reading 4) Navigation. Let's look at them one at a time:

**Memorization:** This is a lot of content. To really make it useful for you, you will have to remember it. You will learn later in Brain OS 4.0 that forgetting is not a bug, but a filtering feature of your Brain Operating System. So to convince your brain to memorize, you need to repeat. Reading the entire book many times is completely impractical. Instead, the clear structure allows you to quickly identify passages you care about and subsequently speed-read them. There is more to say about this topic, but for the sake of introduction we hope you get the gist of it.

**Understanding:** Structured writing slices the information into smaller, easier to digest pieces. When struggling with comprehension, you only need to re-read the slice causing you trouble.

**Speed Reading:** We have highlighted the most salient point of each paragraph, making it easy to identify them when skimming.

**Navigation & Reference:** This is a lot of content. You may want to refer to it. The clear structure in conjunction with lots of visual elements makes it easier to find quickly what you are looking for.

## How Anecdotes work:
Before we look at two anecdotes, please keep in mind that in life-hack they do not work stand alone, but are part in a much larger frame-work, designed to efficiently help you to improve yourself. That said, from the standalone anecdote you still should be able to glean, that they are illuminating one aspect, and they do so being fun, insightful and memorable.

Before you jump into experiencing the first one, I am inviting you to a little mind experiment. Kind of to make you compare what you usually hear versus our ViZdom.

Please try to remember the last time you botched up a project due to lack of self-discipline. ??? It is very likely that in turn, you received a sermon. Can you hear it? Go through it from beginning to end. How did it made you feel? Was it helpful and inspiring? Close your eyes and really experience it.

Now let's do this again with ViZdom:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/comics/intro/premature-discipline.png)

We all have our internal-pig-dog, who always tries to seduce us. Who overpromises, who wants to cut corners, to party, to slack. When we give in, work does not get done, quality goes down. Self-discipline provides the counterforce in our struggle for a healthy balance of fun vs. work. But if you commit to a project which requires more self-discipline than you currently possess, your internal-pig-dog will win and you won't deliver as you promised. Trouble and disappointment will ensue, followed by lost trust. Instead, learn to judge your self-discipline correctly so you don't bite off more than you can chew. Or learn how to increase your self-discipline so you can complete bigger projects successfully in less time. You may also find more peace if you stop fighting your internal-pig-dog. It is a part of you. Instead, see it as a resource. E.g. consult with your internal-pig-dog when planning your next party. Try to love and respect it for its continuous capacity for fun, and  simply counter its influence with self-discipline!

# Real Characters

The one thing that is even more memorable than life-hacks in illustrated anecdotes, are illustrated anecdotes made up of a **consistent cast of characters.** And how better to visualize your own character improvements than by following along the **characters' development in story arcs.** With no further ado, we introduce you to …

## Inspirations R Us

It started innocently enough. We had issues in our team and with ourselves, and started to fix them. Interesting stories ensued. Bobby sketched them out as comics for our own amusement. Kind of to soften the harshness of fixing our flaws. Violet shared them on WeChat. Suddenly we had followers who wanted more. After we got over the shock of laying our souls bare for everyone to nitpick, we kind of liked it, too.

## Eating our Own Dogfood

Meaning, we compiled and developed all these life hacks to fix our own lives. We faced and fixed Asperger, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, failing marriage, depression, nihilism, frustrated teams, and angry teenagers to name just a few … We can't guarantee that what worked for us will work for you. But we can guarantee that we used every single life-hack on ourselves and that it did work! When life throws us a curveball today, we now can react with grace and efficiency, rather than with terror and panic.

## Why we Care to Share

This project is really not the first time we tried to fix ourselves. In each previous attempt we read and applied a new self-help book with passion. Sadly with limited success. This time we dared to develop our own approach. And it worked. We were extremely surprised by just how effective our new approach was! Being blessed with such a success, we felt an urge not to keep it for ourselves. This is our attempt of sharing our stories as we lived them(\*), hoping they will work for you, too. We even made it an Open Source community project on GitHub. More about it below.

(\*) Not all ideas in our stories are our creations. Like everybody else we live on shoulders of giants, being blessed with inspirations of those who came before us and who were kind enough to share their insights. We are particularly grateful to all self-help book authors. They had great ideas on what to change. Please see → ViZdom.Inspiration. However, we needed to find a way on how to apply these changes.

# Gifted by ViZdom

## A True story
My son composed, arranged, played all instruments, audio engineered, and produced a film score only 3 months into beginning to learn about music and how to play instruments. When playing his composition for others, we heard comments like: "Lukas has so much talent!", "He is a genius!", or "He is gifted!". I truly believe that he is gifted. But not in the way you may think, as in gifted with amazing genes. In fact, I think my genes are quite average. Which is a good thing! I also believe (and history has proven) that genius can stem from average heritage. In the words of Goethe – "Every child is born a genius". And one way to produce a genius is by being gifted with ViZdom.

## You can be Gifted Too!
Being educated in ViZdom has prepared Lukas to learn the essence of making music much faster. The same way ViZdom helped him to become a 3D designer, a web programmer, or a musician. All my life I have helped people who were stuck in average jobs producing unnoticeable work to go on and deliver stunning art. It is our dream to give you the hope that you can do the same. We are aiming to write ViZdom clearly enough to inspire you to realize your potential and how to unlock it!

## ViZdom as a Gift!

If it works for you and if you love someone, consider giving them the gift of ViZdom. Starting at only 99 cents US, we did our best to make it affordable, too. At the same time, your support helps us to keep the lights on, buy rice, and to produce more ViZdom for you.

## Contributing Your 2 Cents

What we are trying to accomplish with the community project of ViZdom is to help you bring out your genius.
