# ViStand™ Modular All-in-One

This All-in-One looks so cool that no one will ever guess that you built it from your computer components.

    <strong>Webcam</strong> ViStand is all about recycling computer parts you already have. Say you own a display without a webcam. Simply purchase and place a webcam on your display. The webcam itself is not a ViStand feature. However, hiding and organizing its cable is. Explore ViStand Organizes Cable Clutter and ViStand Naked to see in more detail just how ViStand helps keep your desk free of cable clutter.

    <strong>Microphone</strong> If you own a webcam it probably has a built-in microphone. But if all you need is a microphone, you can use a lapel type mic with a specialized display clip. The Audio Technica ATR4650 Mic is a great example.

  	<strong>Parked Keyboard</strong> The space occupied by your keyboard is perhaps the most valuable real estate on your desktop. Reclaim that space to draw, write, or doodle by parking your keyboard in ViStand’s convenient shelf.
  </v2-switch-text>
  <v2-switch-text>
  	<strong>Parked Headset</strong> Headsets are great in a conference or for gaming, but otherwise they can get in the way. The ViStand headset holder gets them out of the way. Barely visible, yet within easy reach when you get a call.
  </v2-switch-text>
  <v2-switch-text>
  	<strong>VESA Displays 22" … 32"</strong> ViStand is compatible with any display ranging in size from 22" … 34" and having a 75 mm or 100 mm VESA mount.

# ViMount™ Mobile Docking

ViStand with ViMount used as a Mobile Docking Station is designed to streamline the docking process.

# ViStand Naked

A view of ViStand with all included parts assembled. You will never use ViStand without third party parts, but for the first time here you actually can see the product. We designed ViStand so well, that in use it actually disappears. A real marketing problem!

# Any VESA Computer Mount

ViStand is all about recycling computer parts you already own. As such we made it compatible with any VESA computer mount. See below for but a few examples:


## HideIt Alienware

Designed specifically for the Alienware Alpha or Steam
  
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vistand/any-vesa-mount/any-vesa-mount-alienware-raw.png)

## HideIt MacMini

Designed specifically for one Mac mini model. 
 
 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vistand/any-vesa-mount/any-vesa-mount-macmini-raw.png)

## Intel NUC

Intel® NUC Kits include a VESA mount bracket.

## ViCase Bracket

VESA mount for ViCase. The upcoming companion product to ViStand, which is a Mini computer, built completely from desktop parts.

# Universal VESA Computer Mount

While ViStand is compatible with any VESA Computer Mount, you may choose our companion product – ViMount – because of its free airflow and compatibility with just about any small computer or device.

## Made for each other ...

... in both styling and materials.

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vimount/uni-vesa-comp-mount/vimount-match-vistand-raw.png)


## Optimized for Cooling {#six-way-airflow}

ViMount is designed to maximize airflow around all six sides of your device. This is why we lovingly call this the ViMount 6-Way Airflow™. The arrows illustrate that your computer is cooled from all six sides.This is distinctly different than holders made of sheet metal, which act as thermal insulators.

## Fasten your Seat Belt!

Adjustable elastic cord secures your valuable device gently but firmly. 

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vimount/uni-vesa-comp-mount/vimount-secure-notebook-raw.png)


## Mac mini

ViMount is compatible with any version. Even better, if Apple comes out with a new shape it still will work with your old ViMount.

## Laptop

Whatever your laptop size, the ViMount holds it securely. And when you upgrade it, you will not be forced to replace your VESA notebook holder. Also, you may have several notebooks (or tablets), of varying sizes, which all will work when using this as a shared mobile workstation.

## Tablet

Whatever your tablet size, the ViMount holds it securely. And when you upgrade it, you will not be forced to replace your VESA notebook holder. Also, you may have several tablets (or notebooks), of varying sizes, which all will work when using this as a shared mobile workstation.

## Alienware Alpha

Turn the Alpha into a slightly sinister, but seriously sexy All-in-One! Be confident that this configuration will not throttle your Alienware's performance, thanks to the [ViMount 6-Way Airflow™](#six-way-airflow). ??? Fix the link!

 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vimount/uni-vesa-comp-mount/vimount-alienware-raw.png)


## Intel NUC

Even the NUC's ultra small package is held securely in ViMount, when using with 75 mm VESA spacing. You may want to secure it with the elastic cord.
