# You Fix It™

Repair, don't repurchase! Both your wallet and the planet will thank you! Compared to the traditional All-in-One: The death of a single module is **not** the death of the entire computer.

- __Story:__ Making your ViStand Modular All-in-One easy to repair was a core design imperative. From conception through design, beta-testing and after sales support, our focus is on making repairs easy for you. This is head and shoulders above traditional All-in-Ones which sometimes leave the impression that the makers went out of their way to limit your repair options.

- __Image:__
   - Image Title: __Designed for Easy Repair__ 
      - *Image Copy:* With traditional AiO designs the failure of any component, large or small, can render the machine either less productive or entirely toast. Even if repair is technically an option, it may be expensive and require you to leave your computer at a repair center, while you lose productivity and profits. <br>We embrace the philosophy of [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) – wherever possible, we want you to be able to effect repairs and replace components on your own.

# Enhance Comfort

Proven ways to reduce pain and strain while working with tablets and notebooks.

``Begin Art Brief: Slideshow``

- __Binder Name:__ /art/Enhance Comfort
- __Type:__ Slideshow
- __Story:__ Laptops and tablets provide a convenient, portable platform for users, but are not ergonomically‐ideal for long‐term use.  ViStand offers a comfortable solution to this problem.
- __Product Line:__ ViStand
- __Group Name:__/art/vistand/Enhance Comfort
- __Slides:__ 
   - Slide 1 Title: __Free of Headache__ 
      - *Slide Copy:* Raise your Display to eye level, so to keep your head & spine straight without slouching. This greatly reduces muscle tensions, which in turn avoids shoulder pain and headache. 
      - *Image* 
      - *Image Description:* 
	      - Use Solidworks man
	      - Left & Right Split Image :
	      - Left = Good:
	         - Side view of ViStand plus ViMount. User at Desk. Neck & Spine is  straight. Green line shows that.
	      - Right = Bad:
	         - Side view of user with notebook at Desk. User is slouching. Red line shows that.

         - free_of_headache-bad-raw.png
      - Image Processing* ???
   - Slide 2 Title: __Comfortable Wrists__ 
      - *Slide Copy:* Use a real keyboard and mouse. In this case larger is simply better, because your fingers do not need to work so precisely, which simply is more relaxing. Working tense on an small keyboards and touch pads over an extended period of time will cause wrist pain.
      - *Image* 
      - *Image Description:* 
	      - Use Solidworks man
	      - Left & Right Split Image :
	      - Left = Good:
	         - Top view user using full size keyboard and mouse. Large green movement area overlay.
	      - Right = Bad:
	         - Top view user using full notebook with integrated touch pad. Small red movement area overlay.

      - Image Processing* ???
   - Slide 3 Title: __More Energy__ 
      - *Slide Copy:* A 24" display is simply 400% larger than a 12" display. In this case larger is simply better. It is easier on the eyes. At the end of your work you will have more energy left!
      - *Image* 
      - *Image Description:* 
	      - Left & Right Split Image :

# Writing Notes

## Art Workflow

- Develop Art Brief, including Slide Show
- Develop final file & folder names for 

## Slideshow

### When Slideshow over Tabs

### Tabs

Feature pages mostly use tabs. Tabs are great when each tab represents a unique feature. The group of tabs represent consequently a group of features.

### Slideshow

In our case we use slideshow because each slideshow is about one feature. The slides are telling the story of this features, just like a comic strip or movie would. In fact, some of the slideshows we will replace with an interactive movie, that will have an identical user interface just as the slide show.

# To Do List

- [ ] Clean up redundancy of "How it Works" & "Modular All-in-One"
- [ ] Add Tagline: Modular All-in-One Converter & Mobile Docking Station
- [ ] Split presentation into two distinct use cases as per tagline above
- [ ] Add use case of Notebook + Thunderbolt / USB-C Docking Station
   - Slideshow: 1. Thunderbolt 2. USB-C 3. ViDock 
- [ ] ViStand Desktop Beautifier (Common denominator to all use cases ViStand)
- [ ] Group all points into chapter & section (Lukas can style it in the feature page)
   - Do first on the features page, Lukas is laying it out first.
- [ ] Start with pictures **without** interactivity. Their job is to deliver the feel of the product!

## (v2) Making a Stand for the All-in-One (Text Block)

Going vertical is the secret. Elevate your computer off the desktop and mount it high up on the ViStand. As a bonus it is hidden out of sight, too! The second secret is getting the cable clutter out of the way – elegantly – with  ViStand's integrated cable management system. Last but not least it gives you a shelf for your keyboard when not in use. This not only frees even more desk space, but at night your keyboard does not collect dust. And cat owners will notice that their PC is still sleeping in the morning!.

**Note:** We should copy this text block for occasions we need one contiguous copy on this subject

**Idea:** Assembly Animation

# "Correct Method" → Intro

## Directions
- Focus on our messages of reasons of usefulness of ViStand
- Our heroes need to be the visuals
   - Our heroes can not be the text due to wide gamut of audience with so different preferences in text
- Story line is important
- Our text need to comply completely with current American hyper sensitive political correctness
   - not the whole world is on this trip
- We are a disruptive community (innovative and helpful to users and mom & pop shops, and planet)
   - Our share holders are end users, mom & pop shops and planet's representatives.
   - Our reasons of usefulness is our ambassador to deliver that we are disruptive
- Use what we already have as much as possible
- Focus of effort is on Title / Subtitle {Story} & Picture
   - TC turns copy draft into final copy
   - TC actively collects proof reading from schools and universities.
- Must meet deadline of Intro & Features is ready by China team on Friday: 
   - 12:00 lunch: Start internal review including review with TC
   - 3 pm published

## Reference sites for languages
- Apple
- Razer

## Today:

### Intro
1. HC & TC (Restructure) (Section Title / Section Subtitle / Section Story / Section Grouping)
   1.1 Review with Bobby
2. HC & GI (Write Art Briefs & Copy, finished in message, not political correct writing)
   → later 3. Read Razer & Apple as reference on writing (Tom at any time) (optional)
3. HC & GI fill in all writing & art briefs  ← ← URGENT

### Computer for Squality
- Make strong VESA bracket
- Rework PC with pico ATX PSU
- Swap Displays HC / ML so 24" goes onto "Portable Workstation"

## Writing & Artwork
- HC & TC: Structure
- BC: Quick review of structure
- HC & GI fill in structure
- BC & TC review art briefs
- TC polishes the text to American political correct, can be done after Friday

## After Guilin

- Replace Solidworks Man with outline man in Enhance comfort
- Implement Story 2 of Mobile Docking Workstation
- → → Use Case Notebook + Docking Station ← ←
- The story in "You Fix It" is very good, but up until now not used. How to use it?
