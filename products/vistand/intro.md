Your portable (be it a notebook or tablet) is great on the go. But when working on your desk you're living with some compromises regarding screen size, keyboard size, desktop ergonomics, and style. The ViStand lets you create an elegant workstation where you can dock your portable in style while increasing your productivity, comfort, and health. A 22" display, mouse and keyboard are available for  just $100. There is really no reason to strain yourself and limit your work speed on a small display and keyboard. Most Android tablets and iPads support external displays and keyboards too.

# Portable Workstation

Unchain your Desktop!

```
Art Brief
- Image
- Violet Walking with ViStand AiO
```

There are moments where just portable is not enough. When you need the power of a desktop and the ergonomics of a big screen and a full sized keyboard. Yet you want portability too. Your notebook does not deliver, and your desktop chains you to the desk. Yet you want the productivity boost of portability, especially when working in teams. This is where the ViStand Portable Workstation is breaking new ground (or rather old ground, if you remember the first Mac). Let's get *Agile* and illustrate the point with a *User Story*: You just finished the new thing and are called to a meeting. You hibernate your portable workstation, drop your mouse into your pocket and park your keyboard in ViStand and then simply carry your workstation by its grip! When you arrive, plug in power, wake up your PC and place keyboard and mouse on the table. Within a minute you changed your location and are ready to continue on a full fledged workstation.




# ViStand grows with You ...

... as your needs or budget increases you simply upgrade versus upbuying.


New idea: Time Line: 
2016: Bought ViStand Modular All-in-One
2020: Replaced the Mini PC with latest and greatest
2022: Upgraded 24" Display to 34" curved
2024: Replaced the Mini PC with latest and greatest
 ...

The basic idea is, that in the interval where you would have upgraded the entire All-in-One you now only need to upgrade half. And keep in mind that thanks to further modularity, you can keep upgrading other components, such as webcam or speaker at really low cost when you need it.



# You Fix It™

Repair, don't repurchase! Both your wallet and the planet will thank you! Compared to the traditional All-in-One: The death of a single module is **not** the death of the entire computer.

- Story: Making your ViStand Modular All-in-One easy to repair was a core design imperative. From conception through design, beta-testing and after sales support, our focus is on making repairs easy for you. This is head and shoulders above traditional All-in-Ones which sometimes leave the impression that the makers went out of their way to limit your repair options.

   - single image
   - 1x2 up
   - left: good, explosion 6 modules → Chassis, Display, Speaker, Webcam, Power Supply
   - right, bad, →  Monolithic, Pick a generic looking All in One
- *Image Copy:* With traditional AiO designs the failure of any component, large or small, can render the machine either less productive or entirely toast. Even if repair is technically an option, it may be expensive and require you to leave your computer at a repair center, while you lose productivity and profits. <br>We embrace the philosophy of [iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) – wherever possible, we want you to be able to effect repairs and replace components on your own.

- __Product Line:__ ViStand
- __Group Name:__/art/vistand/Enhance Comfort
- __Slides:__ 
   - Slide 1 Title: __Free of Headache__ 
      - *Slide Copy:* Raise your Display to eye level, so to keep your head & spine straight without slouching. This greatly reduces muscle tensions, which in turn avoids shoulder pain and headache.

   - Slide 2 Title: __Comfortable Wrists__ 
      - *Slide Copy:* Use a real keyboard and mouse. In this case larger is simply better, because your fingers do not need to work so precisely, which simply is more relaxing. Working tense on an small keyboards and touch pads over an extended period of time will cause wrist pain.

# Writing Notes

## Art Workflow

- Develop Art Brief, including Slide Show
- Develop final file & folder names for 

## Slideshow

### When Slideshow over Tabs

### Tabs

Feature pages mostly use tabs. Tabs are great when each tab represents a unique feature. The group of tabs represent consequently a group of features.

### Slideshow

In our case we use slideshow because each slideshow is about one feature. The slides are telling the story of this features, just like a comic strip or movie would. In fact, some of the slideshows we will replace with an interactive movie, that will have an identical user interface just as the slide show.

# To Do List

- [ ] Clean up redundancy of "How it Works" & "Modular All-in-One"
- [ ] Add Tagline: Modular All-in-One Converter & Mobile Docking Station
- [ ] Split presentation into two distinct use cases as per tagline above
- [ ] Add use case of Notebook + Thunderbolt / USB-C Docking Station
   - Slideshow: 1. Thunderbolt 2. USB-C 3. ViDock

## (v2) Making a Stand for the All-in-One (Text Block)

Going vertical is the secret. Elevate your computer off the desktop and mount it high up on the ViStand. As a bonus it is hidden out of sight, too! The second secret is getting the cable clutter out of the way – elegantly – with  ViStand's integrated cable management system. Last but not least it gives you a shelf for your keyboard when not in use. This not only frees even more desk space, but at night your keyboard does not collect dust. And cat owners will notice that their PC is still sleeping in the morning!.

**Note:** We should copy this text block for occasions we need one contiguous copy on this subject

**Idea:** Assembly Animation

# "Correct Method" → Intro

## Directions
- Focus on our messages of reasons of usefulness of ViStand
- Our heroes need to be the visuals
   - Our heroes can not be the text due to wide gamut of audience with so different preferences in text
- Story line is important
- Our text need to comply completely with current American hyper sensitive political correctness
   - not the whole world is on this trip
- We are a disruptive community (innovative and helpful to users and mom & pop shops, and planet)
   - Our share holders are end users, mom & pop shops and planet's representatives.
   - Our reasons of usefulness is our ambassador to deliver that we are disruptive
- Use what we already have as much as possible
- Focus of effort is on Title / Subtitle {Story} & Picture
   - TC turns copy draft into final copy
   - TC actively collects proof reading from schools and universities.
- Must meet deadline of Intro & Features is ready by China team on Friday:
