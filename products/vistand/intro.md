      title: '34" Curved'
      desc: This display simply looks awesome and works very well for both work and fun. It is also the largest All-in-One option. Unbelievably, it is even portable thanks to the large grip of ViStand.

      desc: >
        The sweet spot display for cost efficient immersive gaming: at 1080p the resolution can be handled with mid range GPUs,
        yet the ultra wide aspect ratio delivers the immersive game experience and wow factor!
        At about $300 US the displays are quite affordable, too!

      title: Free of Headache
      desc: Raise your Display to eye level, so to keep your head & spine straight without slouching. This greatly reduces muscle tensions, which in turn avoids shoulder pain and headache.

      title: Comfortable Wrists
      desc: Use a real keyboard and mouse. In this case larger is simply better, because your fingers do not need to work so precisely, which simply is more relaxing. Working tense on an small keyboards and touch pads over an extended period of time will cause wrist pain.

      title: More Energy

      <p>A traditional All-in-One will always limit your choices for the display(s). The ViStand Modular All-in-One frees you to choose any display (4k, 120 Hz, IPS), including the one you already own. And, unlike with a traditional AiO, if your needs change, so can your monitor. Don't replace an entire computer when you just need to upgrade one component!</p>

        <p>Your portable (be it a notebook or tablet) is great on the go. But when working on your desk you're living with some compromises regarding screen size, keyboard size, desktop ergonomics, and style. The ViStand lets you create an elegant workstation where you can dock your portable in style while increasing your productivity, comfort, and health. A 22" display, mouse and keyboard are available for just $100. There is really no reason to strain yourself and limit your work speed on a small display and keyboard. Most Android tablets and iPads support external displays and keyboards too.</p>

# Portable Workstation

Unchain your Desktop!

<!--    [Art Brief > Portable Workstation](https://github.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/blob/master/art/vistand/portable-workstation/artbrief.md) -->

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vistand/display-freedom/22-inch/22-inch.jpg)

There are moments where just portable is not enough. When you need the power of a desktop and the ergonomics of a big screen and a full sized keyboard. Yet you want portability too. Your notebook does not deliver, and your desktop chains you to the desk. Yet you want the productivity boost of portability, especially when working in teams. This is where the ViStand Portable Workstation is breaking new ground (or rather old ground, if you remember the first Mac). Let's get Agile and illustrate the point with a User Story: You just finished the new thing and are called to a meeting. You hibernate your portable workstation, drop your mouse into your pocket and park your keyboard in ViStand and then simply carry your workstation by its grip! When you arrive, plug in power, wake up your PC and place keyboard and mouse on the table. Within a minute you changed your location and are ready to continue on a full fledged workstation.




# ViStand grows with You ...

... as your needs or budget increases you simply upgrade versus upbuying.

# You Fix It™

Repair, don't repurchase! Both your wallet and the planet will thank you! Compared to the traditional All-in-One: The death of a single module is **not** the death of the entire computer.

<!--    [Art Brief > You Fix It](https://github.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/blob/master/art/vistand/you-fix-it/artbrief.md) -->

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io/master/art/vistand/you-fix-it/designed-for-repair-raw.png

With traditional AiO designs the failure of any component, large or small, can render the machine either less productive or entirely toast. Even if repair is technically an option, it may be expensive and require you to leave your computer at a repair center, while you lose productivity and profits. 
We embrace the philosophy of iFixit – wherever possible, we want you to be able to effect repairs and replace components on your own.
