# Summary {#summary}

## Spec Comparison {#sum-spec}

Regarding components each computer runs, they remain almost identical, save for a few minor differences. Dell is the only workstation still on the Haswell series, and uses a mobile CPU processor instead of a standard desktop CPU. The rest are all running Intel Skylake, utilizing perks such as DDR4 memory and support for NVME drives.

## Price Comparison {#sum-price}

In all comparisons, ViPC remains price leader for workstation AiO computers. For price / performance, ViPC offers the same specs as competitors but at a lower price. 

![aiopricecomparison](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16950279/16481653/35f91d18-3e61-11e6-8f10-a41f8776632a.png)
 

## Usability Comparison {#sum-usability}

Technical specs are important, but what makes each computer different? Usability takes many factors into regard, such as portability, modular design, and safety. ViPC matches competitors in components, but offers several advantages in usability and overall design of the computer. This is mostly due to modular design, giving plenty of options for users compared to current locked down alternatives. Not only does ViPC offer the user options, but guides them to recommendations tailored for their needs.

<br>

## Grand Summary {#grand-summary}

Workstation all-in-ones are growing in popularity, looking to combine the speed of a workstation computer with the form factor of an all-in-one. With ViPC, we were on a specific mission when designing it; create a open modular system that could be used however the user deemed necessary. Current all-in-ones are limited by a key element: the locked down design impairs the upgradability and options people have with changing it (a key advantage to traditional desktop computing). ViPC combines these two ideas, making not only a case you can choose any components with, but in a sleek, space-saving design.

# Usability Details {#usability-details} 

Technical specs are important, but what makes each computer different? Usability can make everyday computing headache free if done right. Small, everyday actions such as having a keyboard dock or choosing how to orient the ports seem like a standard chassis should have, but are often neglected. The following topics are common features that many consumers want in a computer and we'll see how the different models fair.


## Open Modular Displays {#open-modular-displays}

### Closed Monolithic AiO

Traditional all-in-ones have the display infused with the entire chassis.

**Closed AiO limits your choice of:

- Screen size
- LCD type
- Quality ...

... to what the manufacturer decides on. Some give certain flexibility in the size or screen type, but with hundreds of factors to take into account for monitors, this simply means you are limited in finding the best screen for you. All-in-ones also have no upgrade or repair options to the screen post-purchase, meaning you must buy a whole new machine.

### Open Modular

ViPC AiO lets you choose any monitor you want, including the one you already own. Made possible by utilizing the open modular industry standard of VESA mount. The Display is the single most important interface between you and your computer. This is even more true for practitioners of the visual arts, such as photographers and designer. Resolution, size, density, color accuracy, viewing angle are all factors where the *open modular AiO* gives you full control to optimize features versus your budget.

And because the screen is separate from the components, you can upgrade the screen without changing the rest of the components while still enjoying the benefits of the all-in-one form factor.

### Comparing Screen Options

One of the biggest downsides to all-in-one computers is the lack of future upgrades. With the slim design, many manufacturers take away the option of upgrading key parts such as the screen or graphics card. While they last for quite some time, you eventually have to get rid of the entire system due to lack to upgradeability. ViPC throws this concept out the window, letting the user upgrade every component down to the power supply to make one computer last as long as you own it. Because ViPC uses standard desktop parts, upgrading is easy and not tied down to any standard; use your PC how you want to. We also fully recommend self-upgrading your machine! This saves time and money for both parties, and we have many guides that walk you through the process of doing so. We can also do the repairs or upgrades for you, but give you the option of choosing.

| Feature | ViPC AiO | Traditional AiO |
|----------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Easy Upgrading | yes {gn} | no {rd} |
| Replace Screen | yes {gn} | no {rd} |
| Long Life-span | yes {gn} | no {rd} |

## Open Modular Configuration {#open-modular-config}

    **Art Place Holder***
    - Layout: 3:1, whole width, under paragraph title
    - Current configurator image

Our configurator lets you choose how you want a computer built, with what parts you want inside. Choose from typical components such as power supply or CPU, while getting even more choices like the color of your ViCase cover or an AiO conversion kit. Many configurations are limited to what you can choose, but we want to give the user as much choice as possible to make the perfect machine. And for those that need guidance, we have pre-configured models that are ready made and tested for you.

## Open Modular Formfactor {#open-modular-formfactor}

    **Art Place Holder***

    - Creating loop

Different form factors come with different benefits. Tower PCs are easy to repair and use standard parts, but are large and bulky. All-in-ones mold together the the monitor and components into a single chassis, are suffer in terms of upgradability and performance. Mini-PCs are easy to transport, but often times use mobile parts. Each comes with its own advantages, and different users will want different form factors. ViPC open modular formfactor means we give you control on how you want your computer displayed. Switch from an all-in-one layout to a mini-PC seamlessly, making the best of both worlds a reality.

      - Stick man with frown

In todays world, being mobile is vital for almost every situation. Collaboration has been a growing criteria for businesses and schools, making sharing your work important for all parties. Currently, you have to choose between power or mobility. Traditional desktops / all-in-ones are designed to be kept in a single spot; transporting them is awkward and difficult. Laptops are easy to transport, but leave much in terms of performance. Many people have both a laptop and desktop, but this leads to differences between workflow. 

ViPC AiO is designed to be carried around easily throughout a workplace or home. By incorporating all of the standard peripherals into the case itself, the computer can easily be brought around without causing any headaches. Grips are another point many computers don't include, so we made sure to add grips for pain-free transportation.


## Desktop Parts {#desktop-parts} 

### Desktop Parts vs Mobile Parts

    - *Mobile:*
      - Small mobile graphics, normal wheels with smoke coming from top
      - Stick man riding with frown

### Closed Monolitic AiO
Many all-in-ones use mobile variations of components to keep power usage and size small. Mobile parts have less power consumption, lower clock speeds, and smaller coolers, acting as gimped versions of desktop parts. While useful for devices such as laptops, having mobile parts on an all-in-one limits performance and upgradeability.

### Modular AiO
ViPC uses standard desktop parts for all of its components, running at the intentional speed that item was given. Desktop parts are overclock-able, offer more performance-per-value, and are much easier to replace/upgrade. Some desktop parts such as the CPU cooler and graphics cards are larger than their mobile counterparts due to heat, but ViCase manages to fit these components all in a 6-liter housing.

       - new parts being upgraded
    - *Closed:*

      - image in landfill, 

### Closed Monolithic AiO

Many all-in-one components are fused into the chassis as non-standard parts, such as the screen, power supply, and motherboard. This means that when the time comes to upgrade components, you must replace the entire machine, costing more funds and decreasing the life of the device. Most manufacturers will let you send the product back for repairs, but this costs time and money.

### Modular AiO

Using standard parts around an open computer chassis means your computer can last you as long as you want. Everything in the machine is user replaceable, such as standard ITX motherboards or FLEX ATX power supplies. This also means less waste, and repairing or upgrading the machine can be done yourself with little experience needed. ViPC firmly believes in an open system, so we made sure we incorporated this mindset when it came to the longevity of ViPC.

There are many upsides to going the DIY route, including lower cost, more options, better performance, and the warm feeling of building a computer yourself. While we see the benefits of a pre-made machine, staying DIY still means we can configure your machine for you, while also not locking your computer down in any sort of way.

### Closed Monolithic
Shipping a computer is expensive, time consuming, and potentially harmful to the machine. To get away from doing this many people will buy a laptop for travel, but this introduces two problems; a laptop isn't going to have the same performance as a desktop computer and its another machine you have to manage.

### Open Modular
There are many reasons you would want to travel with your computer. Students going home for the holidays, spending the week at a convention, or travelling for business are a few. Being without your main computer for such trips can be difficult, so we made ViPC as travel-friendly as possible. ViPC is small enough to fit into carry on luggage, saving you time and money by not having to pack it separately. This also mitigates the need for a laptop for travel, making your life much easier by just needing one computer.

### Closed Monolithic AiO
Keeping your computer desk clean can be a difficult task. From your keyboard or drawing tablet to the stacking pile of soda cans, managing desk space isn't easy. Many all-in-ones do a good job of minimizing space below the desk by taking the traditional desktop tower out of the equation, but you still have to manage all of the peripherals on the desk.

Cable messes have always been a nightmare for computer desks. Look behind a desk and you will likely find piles of cables stuffed behind, all tangled and messy. You need power surge protectors, plugs for a monitor, USB hubs, and more. 

###Modular AiO
Managing your keyboard while not in use is a problem many face. Some people unplug it from their computer or flip it on it's side on a ledge, but everyone shares the common problem; where can I put my keyboard for easy storage? We solved this issue by doing the most logical approach, incorporate a keyboard stand into the AiO chassis for storage and transportation. Now, you can simply place your keyboard underneath the screen to sketch some new designs or work in your textbook. 

To battle the famous cable mess issue that computer desks face, we incorporated many common peripherals into the case itself to keep everything in one place.

Everyone uses their computer differently. Some use it mainly for gaming or 3D modeling, while others use it for programming or video rendering. With this, certain configurations are going to be better for working day and night or just light work every couple of hours. Parts like hard drives or power supplies are rated for use, and are important factors to take into regard. If using a computer for heavy work, you'll want gold + rated power supplies and hard drives that are rated to be used continuously. These will cost more and aren't needed if you don't need the amount of reliability, but are a must buy if you do. ViPC configurations use workstation grade components, rated to keep up with your workload without failing.

# Surge & EMI Protection {#surge-emi-protection}

## Safety

With every computer,additional safety peripherals are needed to keep everything in check. For workstation computers, sudden electrical surges can be detrimental, causing many delays if your computer isn't properly protected. Up until now, people had to buy separate surge protectors to keep the components safe in case of electrical failure. ViCase has surge protection and an EMI filter built in, meaning your PC will always be protected no matter where you take it. The built-in DC port also keeps your monitor protected and lessens what you have to plug into the wall.

For computers, dust is their worst nightmare. Dust build-up makes your components run hotter, lessens the life of fans, and covers the shiny exterior of your PC. It can be a hassle to clean PCs, as its an important step to take in keeping your computer running cool and quiet. ViPC not only has high quality dust filters all around the case for great cooling, but the top cover and dust filters are 100% dish washer friendly. A common mistake many people do is use compressed air to blow dust off their computer. While this gets the dust off in the short run, all of that dust doesn't magically disappear; now its floating all over your room. Our filters and cover can be thrown in the sink for true cleansing, keeping the airflow in your PC dust free.

For many, once you buy a PC you can leave it without opening it up. Many all-in-ones are designed like this, making self repairs / upgrades nearly impossible for the average user. For ViPC, we wanted to give easy access for every aspect of the computer, from turning it on to plugging in peripherals. 

The power button on PCs have always been a pain to use. Most of the time you have to reach way back behind the screen or for tower PCs, underneath the desk. Not everyone is going to have their computer set up the same way, so we decided why not let the user choose where to power on their ViPC? We include a remote power button that can be placed on the desk or taped to a wall for easy access no matter where the PC is placed.

Similarly to power buttons, getting to your ports can be difficult. For ViPC AiO, we give you the option to orient the direction of your ports however you want; face them up or down, left or right. For easy access, facing them upwards gives you every port you need just by standing up and looking down at your computer. Facing them downwards will hide any cables sticking out in case you value looks over function. And you can change the orientation any time you want.

PCs in todays era are made to be used, then trashed once the newer models are released. Parts are becoming harder to upgrade and whole systems are needed to be replaced instead of a few select components. Once you own a ViCase, every component can be upgraded individually with standard desktop components, helping out the planet by throwing away less parts.

# Conclusion

ViPC isn't meant to have an outstanding lead in price or performance (although it is the cheapest with identical specs) but excels rather in usability such as portability, a modular system, and integrated safety features. These aren't normally aspects you think about when buying an AiO, but they make day to day life stress-free. ViPC AiO may not have the sleek curves of machines such as the Apple iMac, but when you start ticking down the comparison sheet, you'll see theres more than what meets the eye.
