title: The Missing PC Standard
subtitle: White Paper on benefits of the new PC Standard and comparison to current standards
abstract: >
   This white paper compares the new *PC standard* V² Modular PC to the current All-In-One, Desktop and Mini PC standards, respectively pointing out the lack thereof. In that comparison the reason of being for the new PC standard becomes obvious as it fills a gap not covered by the current standards.

# Solving Problems {#solving-problems}

List of current problems of Desktop PCs and how V² Modular PC Standards solves them:

## Providing Missing Standards {#missing-standards}

### Problem 1: Missing Standards

The table → [PC Core Standards](#core-standards) makes it obvious just how many standards are missing. Whereas the ATX Desktop PC provides all essential standards, the Mini and All-In-One PCs however are basically not standardized. This leads to a lot of problems described in the table below:

### Symptoms of Missing Standards

|          Symptom | Mini & AiO PC | Desktop PC |
|-----------------:|:-------------:|:----------:|
| Development Cost |     — High    |    ✓ Low   |
|     Tooling Cost |     — High    |    ✓ Low   |
|     Product Cost |     — High    |    ✓ Low   |
|      Save Planet |     — Low     |   ✓ High   |
|   Upgradeability |     — Low     |   ✓ High   |


### Solution 1: Providing Missing Standards

The solution is obvious: Develop, publish and market the missing standards. This is exactly what V² Modular PC standards is all about. It is spelled out in → [Mission of V² Modular PC Standards](#mission-v-squared).

## Active Development {#active-development)

### Problem 2: ATX has no Active Development

The set of ATX standards was developed by Intel and then published in 1995. It resides as a passive download repository of PDF files on on [www.formfactors.org](www.formfactors.org). It has no True North, no forum, no bylaws, no contribution workflow. As a consequence no active development is happening. In over two decades the ATX Desktop PC has not adapted to the changing user demands of smaller and quieter PCs. This is the root cause that the form factors Mini PC and All-In-One PC have never been standardized. Leading to the problem of the → [Missing Standards]{#missing-standards}.


### Solution 2: Community Development Platform

V² Modular PC is actively developed by its community. It resides on [https://v-squared.github.io/](https://v-squared.github.io/). When finished it not only hosts the standard documents, but a lot of additional infrastructure to assist makers, retailer and users. All documents are hosted on GitHub as *Open Source* under *Creative Commons License*. Development and contribution is documented as a → [Standardized Contribution Workflow](#standardized-workflow). Anyone with a *GitHub* account can easily contribute. It works exactly like *Wikipedia* where a large community constantly updates its content. 

# Mission of V² Modular PC Standards {#mission-v-squared}

## Making Missing Mini PC Standard Mainstream {#making-modular-pc-mainstream}

Our mission is to develop, publish, promote and maintain all missing standards to enable anyone to develop, make, assemble, use and maintain Mini and All-In-One Computer. To lower any entry barriers, reduce cost, and reduce trial and error in development and assembly.

At V² we are a global community of architects, thinkers, engineers and marketeers working together to achieve our vision of an open modular mini or All-in-One PC Standard. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential for individual and collective growths.

## Analogy to ATX Desktop PC Standard {#analogy-to-atx}

Desktop ATX computers were the best selling PC form factor, because the ATX standard made them to be lowest cost, fastest to develop, easiest to build and upgrade. But this de facto standard is 30 years old and was never updated to fit the needs of mini and all-in-one form factor. The V² Standard fills this vacuum. By using the exact same principles that the ATX standard used on desktop PCs, the V² Standard is lowering the cost, increasing development speed and performance, and simplifying upgrades for mini an All-In-One PCs. In doing so, V² is breathing new life into mini and All-In-One PCs.

# Plan on How to make it Happen {#plan-v-squared}

Developing, publishing and making a standard mainstream is no small feat. When looking at the history of other successful standards such as USB or PCI you will find that they all took over 10 years. We started in 2011 and are about half way through. Development of the core standards has been completed. 2016 sees the first shipping products based on the new V²Standard. All core standards will be completed publishing by middle of 2017.
