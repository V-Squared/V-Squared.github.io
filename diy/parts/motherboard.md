## The problem this article solves
There are a huge number of motherboard out there, each with a very long list of features. To make matters worse, you will connect a lot of other components into the Motherboard, all of which have a long list of features themselves. And of course not all Motherboards are compatible with all parts. So if later you want to use a certain part and the motherboard you have picked does not support it, then you are buggered.

## How this Article solves the problem
This Article is part of three community projects, all designed to simplify building DIY PCs

- **ViCase:** Indiegogo Project. A DIY Mini and All-IN-One Computer Case System
- **V²Configurator:** GitHub Project. The Configurator assists you when configuration your PC
- **This Article Series:** In depth Know How. In case you want to tune Ready Made Configurations of the V² Configurator

## Is there an easier way
Yes! Learning how to choose components for a DIY computer is time consuming. This is why we created a shortcut for you. Go to the V²Configurator and open the Wizard. Pick your Field of Application, say e.g. Photography and then pick the Main Use and the Configurator will custom build a complete computer for you, optimized for your Use Case and Performance class.


# How this Article works
## Classes of Motherboards

This Article is providing choices of Motherboards for the two performance classes:


2. **Entry Level:** Total cost of Computer: $800+
3. **High End:** Total cost of Computer: $1300+



## Side by side comparison
We have selected 2 Motherboards for you covering the range from everyday computing to extreme performance. We put them into one table for most convenient side by side comparison. All features are explained in another table.

## Assign Motherboards to Use Cases
To make picking a Motherboard easier the V²Configurator simply asks you about your Use Case and your performance class and picks the right motherboard for you.

# Advice
## Entry Level Motherboard

The Gigabyte H170N has all of the features any typical user would want with a motherboard; built-in AC Wifi, USB 3 ports + USB type-C, PCI-e Gen3 M.2 connector for NVME drives, plenty of SATA ports, and high quality components. This motherboard does not support overclocking, so this would be ideal for someone who wants to leave their computer without tinkering. 


## High End Motherboard
Choose this board if you are looking for ultimate performance. Lets break it down into sections: 1) Disks: Very high performing RAID 5 Controller. We use this in the high end configurations to give you very large Data Disks at speed levels similar to SSD and security even beyond. 2) NVME-M2: This port is 600% faster than SATA 3. A dramatic improvement. 3) 32 GB DDR4. You can use more memory and it is 40% faster than DDR3. 4) New CPU Socket 1151: It gives you all these cool features and makes your board future proof. 5) Integrated 4K Display support: Connect the latest 4K display without the need to add a GPU card. 6) Built-in WiFi. 7) If you are looking for the fastest PC possible, choose this board with confidence. ViCase comes  with the matching CPU cooling solution, so you can run even the biggest CPU at 100% load all the time without thermal throttling.  The V²Configurator has high end configurations to turn all these extras into a much faster computer for you.
