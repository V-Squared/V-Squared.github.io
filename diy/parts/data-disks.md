Western Digital is a highly regarded brand, with many high rated drives on sites such as Amazon and Newegg. Reliability is key, so choosing a drive with low failure rates is important.

## Advice

### Spinning Drive

While solid state drives are continuously dropping in price, spinning disk drives are still king in terms of price/GB. Whenever storage is a must, HDD are pefect for photos, videos, single player games, and setting up as a backup drive. If you have a RAID configuration with two HDDs, you can achieve similar speeds of a SSD, with more more storage at a lower cost.

### Solid State Drive

As the years go by, prices in SSDs continue to drop and the storage capacities go up. It's possible to buy 2TB SSDs, giving plenty of space at amazing speeds. Using a SSD for storage can be useful for professionals such as video editors, as lower export times can shave a lot off of a timeline. But for the majority of people, standard hard drives for data are fast enough.

### Recommendations of Capacities

For the spinning disk drives, 1TB is a safe and cheap amount of space to hold all of your data. For most people, this is plenty of space for games, music, videos, and documents, making it ideal for the average user. For those that need more, a 2TB or 3TB drive is recommended to make space a non-issue.

For a solid state drive, 500GB would be the minimum for data due to 120GB or 250GB just filling too quickly. 1TB or 2TB SSD (possibly in RAID) would yield the most storage and fastest performance, but this is also the most expensive option.
