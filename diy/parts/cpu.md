# Introduction

## The problem this article solves
There are a huge number of CPUs out there. They all have different performance and cost. You need to know what performance you need for your application. And to complicate matters, nowadays CPUs are not only about CPU performance, they also can integrate the GPU and the RAID controller. Next you need to pick the right motherboard that matches the capabilities of the CPU.

## How this Article solves the problem
This Article is part of three community projects, all designed to simplify building DIY PCs

- **ViCase:** Indiegogo Project. A DIY Mini and All-IN-One Computer Case System
- **V²Configurator:** GitHub Project. The Configurator assists you when configuration your PC
- **This Article Series:** In depth Know How. In case you want to tune Ready Made Configurations of the V² Configurator

## Is there an easier way
Yes! Learning how to choose components for a DIY computer is time consuming. This is why we created a shortcut for you. Go to the V²Configurator and open the Wizard. Pick your Field of Application, say e.g. Photography and then pick the Main Use and the Configurator will custom build a complete computer for you, optimized for your Use Case and Performance class.


# How this Article works
## CPU Classes

This Article is providing choices of CPUs divided into three performance classes:

1. **Entry Level:** Total cost of Computer: $200+
2. **Mid Range:** Total cost of Computer: $500+
3. **High End:** Total cost of Computer: $1000+



## Side by side comparison
We have selected 5 CPUs covering the range from lowest cost to most powerful. We put them into one table for easy side by side comparison. All features are explained in another table.

## Assign CPUs to Use Cases
To make picking a CPU easier the V²Configurator simply asks you about your Field of Application and Main Use Case and then picks the right CPU for you.

## Advice
Short advice which CPU to choose for which purpose

## Advice for choosing a CPU

### Sempron-2650
Choose this CPU if you are looking for the lowest cost or for the lowest power consumption. You can even turn off one of the two cores and the whole system will use 6W only at full load. Ideal for a general purpose low cost PC or for a presentation PC, such as a large size 28" picture frame to replace an A2 printer or presentation displays in meeting rooms, lobby, hotels, etc. The very low power consumption allows the use of a passive cooler, which makes this PC completely maintenance free and literally silent when paired with an SSD. Performance will feel like a decent tablet. Recommended OS Ubuntu. It also may serve as a streaming PC for Gaming or Video. Be aware that in some countries an Intel Celeron CPU is lower cost and at the same time faster.

### Athlon 5350
This is the speed upgrade for the Entry Level System. It is 3 x faster than the Sempron-2650 and almost as fast as the Pentium-G3250. This CPU will give you a very snappy Office / General Purpose PC. The power budget is still very small with 25W in total, which leads to additional savings in power supply and CPU cooler. Bear in mind that this is the fastest CPU that you can plug into the Entry Motherboard. If you plan on growing the performance of your PC, then you will be better served with the Mid Range Motherboard. But if you are looking for lowest cost, low power consumption HTPC / Office PC, this is the best value — with quite a margin.

### i3-4160
The i3 is about twice the speed than the Athlon 5350. Also GPU performance is another mark up. Now you can play games such as Minecraft or work with more demanding Apps. E.g. most Video Editing up to 1080p will be fine.  E.g. we edited our Indiegogo Pitch Video on this CPU w/o GPU. This CPU uses the same LGA 1150 socket. This means you can replace this CPU at a later time even with an i5 or i7 Quad Core. Enough room to grow. Pairing the i3 with the GTX-750 will be your entry ticket to the world of high end gaming.

### i5-4570S
This is another mark up. Besides faster CPU score via Quad Core also get Hyper-V, ideal if you plan to run virtual machines. This CPU is also powerful enough to drive bigger GPU cards that GTX 750, such as the GTX 970.

### i5-6500
This is the latest generation of Quad Core CPU. Choose this CPU for High End Gaming, Video Editing, Audio Editing, Photo Editing, 3D Design or other very demanding applications. Instead of going all the way to an i7 Quad Core you often get higher performance for your money by investing into a PCIe Add In Card of the type corresponding to your application. The i5-6500 CPU comes with the newly released LGA 1151 socket with the key benefit to support DDR4. DDR4 memory clock starts today at 2133 MHz, versus 1600 MHz of DDR3. Yet you will not see today faster memory transfer rates in real life. This is because the CAS timing is more relaxed as with DDR3 memory. Surely this will change in the future. However, there is one benefit that you can enjoy instantly. DDR4 will allow in an ITX motherboard 32 GB, whereas DDR3 will max out at 16 GB!

### i7-6700K
Choose this CPU if you are looking for the Ultimate in CPU performance.

## When to choose 1150 and when 1151
At time of this writing (November 2015) the choice is made by availability: Only i5 and i7 Quad Core CPUs are available with the new socket 1151. 

## i7 4790K vs i7 6700K
- [Puget Systems►i7 4790K vs i7 6700K](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Haswell-vs-Skylake-S-i7-4790K-vs-i7-6700K-641/)

### Our conclusion of benefits of i7-6700
- The new CPU is a little faster, in average 5 ... 10% in real world applications'
- DDR4 memory is significantly lower cost than fast DDR3 memory of same clock speed
- A little lower CPU temperature
- No dramatic improvement, but considering the small improvement and this is a new socket (more future proof) it makes more sense to invest into a i7-6700 now versus an i7-4790.
- more solid UHD / 4K Display support
- 40% more bandwidth
