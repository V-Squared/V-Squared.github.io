# Introduction

## The problem this article solves
There are a huge number of memory's configuration out there. They all have different performance and cost. You need to know what performance you need for your application. Next you need to pick the right motherboard that matches the capabilities of the Memory you want.

## How this Article solves the problem
This Article is part of three community projects, all designed to simplify building DIY PCs

- **ViCase:** Indiegogo Project. A DIY Mini and All-IN-One Computer Case System
- **V²Configurator:** GitHub Project. The Configurator assists you when configuration your PC
- **This Article Series:** In depth Know How. In case you want to tune Ready Made Configurations of the V² Configurator

## Is there an easier way
Yes! Learning how to choose components for a DIY computer is time consuming. This is why we created a shortcut for you. Go to the V²Configurator and open the Wizard. Pick your Field of Application, say e.g. Photography and then pick the Main Use and the Configurator will custom build a complete computer for you, optimized for your Use Case and Performance class.


# How this Article works

## Side by side comparison
We have selected 8 memory's configuration covering the range from lowest cost to most powerful. We put them into one table for easy side by side comparison. All features are explained in another table.

## Assign Memory to Use Cases
To make picking a memory's configuration easier the V²Configurator simply asks you about your Field of Application and Main Use Case and then picks the right memory for you.

## Advice
Short advice which Memory to choose for which purpose

# Understanding Memory
## DDR3 vs DDR4
These are the key differences

| Memory Type:        |DDR3       |DDR4     |
|:--------------------|:-------:  |:-------:|
|Clock Speed(MHz)     |1600       |2133     |
|Operating Voltages   |1.35V ... 1.5V|1.05V ... 1.2V|
|Power Consumption    |Higher     |Lower    |
|Max Mem size in ITX  |16 GB      |32 GB    |
|Pins                 |240 pins   |288 pins |

Please note that DDR3 is at the end of its life cycle. This means it is very mature and offers the best value. DDR4 is just at the beginning of its life cycle and it comes at a premium.
 
 
## Memory speed with and without overclocking
Recent CPUs all have the same standard memory clock speeds:

| Memory Type:        |DDR3       |DDR4     |
|:--------------------|:-------:  |:-------:|
|Clock Speed(MHz)     |1600       |2133     |

If you want to go faster you need two things:

1. Motherboard that allows overclocking
2. Memory that is rated at a higher clock rate

Please read the respective manufacturers advice on overclocking. From the moment on that you start over clocking you are responsible to keep your system reliable.

## Dual-channel memory architecture
Each Memory Module is 64 Bit. Today's CPUs have a 128 Bit memory connection. For this reason two Memory Modules will give you twice the memory speed than only one module. In other words when choosing memory for your Motherboard, always use two modules of the same kind to benefit from double speed. This is called Dual-channel memory architecture.

# Memory Comparison

## Memory Comparison Table

| Memory Feature          |DDR3       |DDR4     |
|:--------------------    |:-------:  |:-------:|
|Speed(MHz)               |1600       |2133     |
|Overclock Speed(MHz)     |1600       |3200     |
|Max Mem Size in ITX MoBo |16 GB      |32 GB    |
|MoBo Class               |Entry & Mid|High     |
|Profile (1)              |Low        |High     |
|ViCase CPU Cooler        |Cooler-L (2)|Cooler-XL (3)|

- (1) Memory Modules come with Low Profile and High Profile. Since we use DDR3 in cost sensitive Entry and Mid Range configurations and DDR4 in performance demanding High End Builds, we chose all DDR3 modules to be Low Profile and all DDR4 Modules to be High Profile
- (2) ViCase-Cooler-L is a very cost efficient design without heat pipes. It does not allow space for High Profile Memory Modules. 
- (3) ViCase-Cooler-XL uses 5 heat pipes. This not only makes it a very powerful CPU cooler, but the design also made space for High Profile Memory modules.

## Thoughts on picking Memory Modules
### The Entry & Mid MoBo: DDR3 1600 MHz

- [2 GB DDR3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239850) lowest cost. There was no point in choosing 1 GB Module, as it almost costs the same.
- [4 GB DDR3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148758) Low Profile so it does not collide with Cooler-L
- [8 GB DDR3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148544) Low Profile so it does not collide with Cooler-L
- [16 GB DDR3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231606) Low Profile so it does not collide with Cooler-L

### The High End MoBo: DDR4  2133+ MHz

- [2 x 4 GB DDR4](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148864) Most common DDR4 memory on Newegg. This is also the smallest available. 
- [2 x 8 GB DDR4](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820104530) Fast CAS Latency, Good Heat Spreader, 5 Star Reviews, Moderate Price
- [2 x 16 GB DDR4](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820233866) Good heat spreader, decent CAS, moderate price

# Advice
## Avoid collision of Memory Module with CPU Cooler
Memory Modules come with Low Profile and High Profile. Low Profile will work with ViCase-Cooler-L. High Profile Modules may collide with the Cooler-L, depending on your Motherboard layout. As always, if you do not want to be troubled with such details, use the Wizard of the V²Configurator. All our ready made configurations using High Profile Memory Modules use the ViCase-Cooler-XL to ensure conflict free assembly for you. Its more expensive design based on heat pipes allows for larger memory modules. To make life simple, all DDR3 memory modules we selected are Low Profile and all DDR4 Modules are High Profile. This makes for straight forward paring: DDR3 with ViCase-Cooler-L and DDR4 with ViCase-Cooler-XL.

## Always use two Memory Modules
Each Memory Module is 64 Bit. Today's CPUs have a 128 Bit memory connection. For this reason two Memory Modules will give you twice the memory speed than only one module. In other words when choosing memory for your Motherboard, always use two modules of the same kind to benefit from double speed. This is called Dual-channel memory architecture. All our ready made configurations use two Memory Modules, except for the lowest entry level configuration where lower cost was more important than speed.

## Memory for Entry Level
Choose a single Memory Module of 2 GB DDR3 for Entry Level systems if cost is paramount. For $14 more you get 4 GB and twice the memory bandwidth, which is good value for money. Choose 1600 MHz over 1333, because it is faster and when shopping carefully you can find the 1600 MHz for the same price.

## Memory for Mid Range
Choose 4 GB DDR3 in 2 x 2GB Modules @ 1600 MHz if you run standard applications. If you run virtual machines, go for 8 GB. More memory is always better, but there is also hitting the ceiling with very diminished returns on your investment. If in doubt, check respective forums of your app and ask around how much memory they are using.

## Memory for High End
Choose 8 GB DDR4 in 2 x 4GB Modules @ 2133 MHz when you run most demanding Apps. Also consult with the documentation of your App, they may recommend more. More memory is always better, but there is also hitting the ceiling with very diminished returns on your investment. If in doubt, check respective forums of your app and ask around how much memory they are using. If you are running demanding apps in virtual machines you may want to start with 16 GB.

# Conclusion
## DDR4 is the future
DDR4 is the future. Immediate benefits are that a DDR4 Mini-ITX system supports 32 GB, whereas a DDR3 Mini-ITX only supports 16 GB. When running very demanding apps or running virtual machines this extra memory makes a difference. Real world memory benchmarks show no big speed difference today. This will change in the future. DDR3 is at the end and DDR4 at the beginning of its life cycle.
## Always use two Memory Modules
This is the most important thing to remember from this Article: Two Memory Modules are twice as fast than one!
## Recommended Memory Size

| Performance Level | Minimum Memory Size |
|------------------:|:--------------------|
|Entry Level        | 2 GB Single Module  |
|Mid Range          | 4 GB DDR3 in 2 x 2GB Modules @ 1600 MHz|
|Mid Range          | 8 GB DDR4 in 2 x 4GB Modules @ 2133 MHz|
