# How to Build an All-In-One Workstation

An all-in-one computer is exactly what it sounds like; takes the traditional separation of desktop tower and monitor then combines it into a single machine.

# Benefits

## Smaller footprint

An AiO can be placed on a desk at home or in an office with minimal space used; the only necessary space is the screen, keyboard, and mouse.


# Disadvantages

## Minimal upgradability
Most all-in-one computers use mobile parts that are difficult to upgrade. Because everything is packed into a package, repair/upgrades won’t be as streamlined as they are with a traditional desktop tower. This is the main downside to an AiO computer; minimal, space saving design but less options for changing parts. 


## No screen options
Especially relevant for photographers, the quality of your monitor is very important when doing any sort of editing. Monitors vary in size, pixel density, reflectivity, refresh rate, color accuracy, and viewing angle, so not having the option to change the screen without buying a new machine can be problematic to some.

# DIY AiO
In most cases, doing it yourself results in higher performance, lower cost, more options, and less polished. This is a segment where ViPC can insert itself, giving users the best of both worlds. By letting users choose the monitor they want and use standard desktop components, price remains low while flexibility remains high. With the ViPC AiO adapter and included DC ports in ViCase, simplicity isn’t lost when going the DIY route.
