# PC Comparison (v4) {#pc-comparison-v4}

## Improvements v4 → v3
- Switched to 4 Groups: ( Work | Gaming | Design | Lightning )
- Naming of Groups is very intuitive. It makes picking the right PC for the reader very easy.
- Changed product name from ViCase to ViPC. Now have two different names for two different products
- Re-Introduced AM1 with a great placement. Deliver great entry level value and expands usability of ViPC
- Added number of cores in table to promote all Game PCs have 4 cores

# Common Specs {#common-specs}

| Common Features     | Detail     |
|:-------------------|:-------|
| High-tech Dust Filter | Ultra low airflow resistance.<br>Ultra low noise.<br>Magnetic quick release mount.<br>Washable.  |
| Three Chamber Cooling | This is a new and innovative cooling system resulting in greatly reduced computer noise. Two key improvements over traditional PC cooling: **1)** Each of the three heat generators (CPU, GPU, PSU) takes in cold air from outside versus hot air from inside the case. **2)** Hot air is immediately removed from case without heating up other components first.
| ViCase-VESA Bracket Interface | Four sets of Twin-slotted holes on bottom of case to hang onto ViCase-VESA Bracket. Supports mounting connectors in four directions: Up, down, left, right.
| ViCase-Feet Interface | Compatible with ViCase-Feet to place you PC portrait and reducing its foot print by -60%.
| Shock Mount| Rubber Grommets to dampen shock and reduce vibration of disks Flex ATX PSU to avoid resonance noise between HDD, PSU fan and CPU fan. 
| Noise Dampening | 1) Butyl Noise absorption foil on inside of case to absorb noise.<br>2) Large diameter low speed CPU fan
| Security | Kensington Lock Port |
| 12 USB Ports |6 x USB 3.0 port (SuperSpeed)<br>5 x USB 2.0 (HighSpeed)<br>1 x USB 2.0 internal for optional Arduino|
|Skylake | Skylake is the latest Intel CPU Generation, introduced just at the end of 2015. This generation came with big changes: New DRAM socket (DDR3 → DDR4), new CPU socket: (1150 → 1151) and RAID support for all Motherboards. All ViCase Models use Skylake. So for many years to come upgrading is easy and low cost as the new sockets are here to stay.
|Network | Ethernet Gigabit Port, WiFi Antenna mounting holes |
|SSD Cache | SSD Caching gives you the best of both worlds: This new technologies marries the speed of SSD with the size and low cost of HDD. As you use your system it learns which files you use frequently and keeps them on the SSD cache. Your computer automatically becomes faster. |
|Turbo Boot| All systems are configured for very fast boot  |
| Disk RAID | All chosen motherboards support Disk RAID. In ViCase models with more than one drive we have already configured it to give you the fastest possible performance. In case you add drives later, you can add RAID too at no extra cost.|
|Turbo Boost| All CPUs and motherboards in all ViCase Models support Turbo Boost. When your app needs more performance the CPU kicks into a higher gear to deliver you a smoother user experience.|
| Audio | 2 x 3.5mm headphone/microphone combo port<br>1 x 3.5 mm Microphone Port<br>4 x 3.5 mm Loudspeaker Port Dolby 2.0 ... 7.1 (only in models: Ultra and Extreme) <br>Dolby® Digital Plus Home Theater Edition 7.1 Codec support (via HDMI)|

- **Operating System:** You choose your Pre-Installed OS:
   1. Windows® 10 (64-Bit) is included in price
   2. LINUX Ubuntu at $99 US discount.
- (\*1) **Silent:** as virtually inaudible or technically 15 dBA. The PC noise is equivalent to a person shallow breathing at 1 m ( 3 feet ) distance. 
- (\*2) **Quiet:** as in barely noticeable or technically 25 dBA. This is caused by adding the hard disks. Removing the disks from the configuration will make your PC silent again when operating under idle to medium loads.
- (\*3) **Normal loudness:** as in noticeable background noise or technically 35 dBA. This is caused mostly by the GPU fan.



# Full Customization {#full-customization}

# Choose Base Models for efficient building {#choose-base-models}

## How is this relevant

If we choose the parts of the different base models right it is possible to build a base system and test it. A base system includes: 

1. Case 
2. Power Supply
3. Motherboard
4. Boot Disk

## One Power Supply for all Models

- We choose high quality 80 Plus Gold 300W. It is quiet, powerful, cool and high quality
- One power supply for all PCs makes it easy to build one base model that can be configured into any final shipping PC
- The customer has complete freedom it expand the PC later, since any possible configurations are covered by this PSU

## One Motherboard for all common models

We choose one Motherboard for all common models. Relatively low cost of this Motherboard combined with high run rate makes it cost efficient to always have some pre-build and tested systems available with it.  Only for the high end model we choose one with the special features:

1. M.2 Socket for NVME aka PCIe SSD (about 5x faster than SATA3)
2. 4k @ 60 Hz Display connector

One Motherboard only will allow to build base models and test them. For more information, please see the → "Proposed assembly workflow" below.
