# Purpose of Portable AiO

## Portable vs Chained to Desk

## Portable vs Laptop

# How to make it Happen

## Hibernation

## Single Cable Only

## Wireless Mouse & Keyboard

## Everything on the Grip

# Features

__Simple & Elegant__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/v2-diy-aio-front-view.jpg)

This is front view of the DIY All-in-One with the keyboard placed in the shelf.

__Grip__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/headset-hook-2.jpg)

I used the very first Mac which came with a carry grip. I have missed the grip ever since on all my subsequent computers. This one is placed in the center of gravity with a nice smooth shape to not cut into your fingers.

__Carrying via Hand Grip__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/carry-via-grip.jpg)

The carry grip is sufficient for short distances, say from your work room to the living room. For reference, this is a 1.8 m tall person carrying an All-in-One with 28" display.


__Carrying via Shoulder Strap__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/carry-via-strap.jpg)

You can use a shoulder strap for longer walks.

__Single Cable Connection__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/only-one-cable.jpg)

Changing your location is so fast, because you only need to handle this one power cable.

__Microphone & Speaker__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/speaker-and-microphone.jpg)

Placement of your speaker and microphone behind your display. They are connected with cables through the cable break outs as shown below.

__Shelf for Mouse & Utensils__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/shelf-with-utensils.jpg)

The integrated shelf can carry your mouse, pens, eraser, and so forth.

__Keyboard in Shelf__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/shelf-with-keyboard.jpg)

It also fits a full size keyboard, keeping your desk free for other tasks or stores your keyboard when carrying your workstation. And cat owners will find their PC still sleeping in the morning :-).

__Quiet Airflow__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/airflow.jpg)

The CPU cooler sucks in cold air (blue arrow), leading to very efficient and quiet cooling. The hot air exhausts through the two grills on the side (red arrow). This is a simple airflow, yet more efficient and quiet than that of common desktop cases.

__Power On, Status LED & USB__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/power-status-usb.jpg)

The round thing is where you power on / off your PC, check its status LEDs or plug in other temporary USB devices.

__Headset Hook__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/headset-hook-2.jpg)

When not in use this hook keeps your headset of your desk.

__Display Tilt__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/titl-display.jpg)

You can adjust the display tilt at the time when you mount your display.

__Easy Access to IO__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/easy-access.jpg)

We placed the IO panel facing upwards. This gives you easy access to it. Yet cable mess is reduced to a minimum as all cables can enter into the two holes left and right to the IO panel.

__Hidden Cables__

![](https://v-squared.github.io/diy/aio/portable-diy-aio/hidden-cables.jpg)

All cables are inside the cover and hidden from sight. This gets cables out of the way when carrying your workstation and also keeps the cosmetic appearance clean.

## Cutting

- Total need to cut 4 pcs
- Pay attention to the direction of the grain. It is marked in the drawing.
- Corner cuts are 45°

## Drilling

### Drill Templates

__Using the Drill Template for Mobo & Disk__

1. __Print the templates 1:1.__ You may need to adjust your print settings to do so.
2. __Verify Scale:__ Check with a ruler if the 100 mm marks are really 100 mm apart. If not, then you need to adjust your print settings and print again until you have a true to scale print. This is important so that your drill holes that match the mounting holes of your devices. Another way to check is to place your motherboard onto the template. The outline and drill holes must match up!
3. __Place in final position:__ The drill template shows the parts in true to scale size. Place your drill template so that the parts are in the final position you want. Fix it with tape. You can mark your hole position with the respective marking tool or you can simply drill through the template and toss it afterwards.
4. __Use waste board:__ You need to drill through. Place a board you do not care about under your work sheet. This way you drill into that one and not your beloved table.
5. __Drill from mounting side:__ Depending your skill and whether you are using a drill press or not your holes will be more or less orthogonal. This will be less of a problem in terms of your drill holes match up with the position of your mounting holes if you drill from the mounting side.
6. __De-burr:__  Use a 10 mm HSS metal drill bit with your hand to cut off any burrs. Especially on your drill exit side.


__Power Supplies__

1. Place the power supplies onto the back board into their final position
2. Mark the drill holes with the awl
3. Remove the power supplies and drill 2 mm holes about 10 mm deep

__Hand Grip__

1. Mark the Center Holes
2. Use the 25 mm bit to drill the holes
3. Use the wood saw to cut the connection between the two holes
4. Smooth the inside edges with the wood file
5. Repeat the process with sand paper. Start with 90, then 180, then 360, then 600 until smooth

__VESA Bracket__

1. Place the VESA bracket onto the front side of the Back Board.
2. Align top edge of the VESA bracket to the connecting line between the top motherboard screw holes
3. Center the bracket
4. Mark holes with awl
5. Drill holes from the mounting side 5 mm Ø
6. De-burr from both sides

## Painting

This is the joy of DIY. Express yourself. Like to have a natural Oak computer. This is your chance. Or you prefer a screaming red punk version? Or simply black? After you cut, drilled, and sanded your wood parts you can paint them any color you want. If you choose a solid color then first apply wood filler. Sand thereafter and apply the solid color, polish with a fine sand grain like 1000, spray paint again, polish again and finally apply a spray lacquer.

## Assembly

### Mounting Side Board

1. Place first Side Board on Base Board. Fix it with 2 L-brackets. Each L-brackets use 4 pcs of 4 mm Ø wood screws, pan head, 15 mm long.
2. Repeat process for second Side Board.
3. Repeat Process for Back Board. Back board is connected with two L-brackets each to the Left Side, Base Board and Right Side

## Wiring

### DC GND Wiring

__Actual Wiring__

The Grounding cable of the HDPLEX AC-DC PSU is screwed in between two 10 mm Brass spacer. One spacer is male-female, other space is male-male. Ring terminal goes in between their mating.

__How DC GND is Connected to AC Earth__

1. ATX cable of DC-DC PSU plugs into motherboard and connects DC GND of PSU to DC GND of motherboard
2. DC Ground of motherboard is connected to mounting holes of motherboard
3. Motherboard is connected with M3 screws to spacer, one of which is connected to GND of AC-DC PSU
4. AC-DC PSU earth wire should be connected to AC Earth prong of the AC cable
5. The Earth prong of the AC power outlet is connected to Ground, as in hammer a steel pole into the ground.
6. All connector shells of the motherboard are connected to DGND of the motherboard. Thanks to our wiring it is connected to Earth which will assist in dissipating Electro Static Discharges (ESD) and thus avoid crashes of your commuter or premature aging of computer parts.
