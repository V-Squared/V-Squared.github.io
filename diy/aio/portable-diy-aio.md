## Awaited Learning


__Portable Solidworks Workstation:__ We are getting ready to visit factories for ViCase production. A portable Solidworks Workstation is a big help. This is an interesting additional early sample experience further informing design details for real world use for ViCase.

# Misc Learning

## Lasercut Cardboard

Will this be an efficient way to quickly and with low cost make custom product and shipping boxes?

## Referral Income

We figured out a second revenue income stream: Put our DIY articles on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) and add shopping lists to amazon and newegg with links using their referral system so to earn the referral fee on a joint checking account. We can split income according to ratio of work invested.

## New way to get traffic

Articles on [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/) should also bring us traffic to the web site. It is one more avenue for the _Publisher_ of a VÂ²Article to create traffic for it.
