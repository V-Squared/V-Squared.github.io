# Desktop Cooling

There are two main methods to cooling a desktop computer, each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Active cooling uses conventional fans to move cool air into a case while hot air is pushed out. Watercooling uses liquid to cool components, connecting to a radiator to keep temperatures down.


## Air Cooling

Air-cooled cases rely on proper fan setup to keep the cold air in and hot air out. With traditional desktop towers, fans would be seperated into two categories; pushing and pulling air. The idea behind air cooled machines is that as components give off heat, fans pull the hot air out of the case. On the opposite end, other fans pull cool air from the outside in. In theory this creates a system of airflow that keeps the components cool.

Upsides to aircooling is much lower extry cost, and universal support for cases. Downsides of aircooling include:

- Higher chance of failure (more fans with moving parts)
- Increased dust
- Loud 


## Water Cooling



## Overclocking
