# Target of Campaign 1 {#target}

**V²Site Launch** is about creating the V² web site that publishes our vision, how we will get there, who we are and how this helps you. We also create the tools to make contribution very easy and fast. This helps us work faster and will attract more contributors to help V² move faster. Finally it gives you very easy methods to report bugs and request features via Article Issues and and in turn provides us with the tools to track, rate and close these issues very efficiently. Finally we create a Work Flow System that is guiding Contributors when working down their tasks and issues to deliver work so that it fits in directly without lengthy reworks.


# Preparing for Campaign 2 {#preparing}

Campaign 2 is all about spreading the word in our community about V² by means of shipping product solving people's problems. We want to do this by maximum engagement with our community, making it very easy to report bugs, provide ideas or providing ready made improvements via Pull Requests. The idea is to make members of the community excited that we listen to what people really need and implement improvement ideas very quickly in both the web site and shipping products. This Campaign 1 is laying the foundation by building the V² Site that provides all these services and tools.
