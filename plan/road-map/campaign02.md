# Based on Campaign 1 {#based-on}

You have heard of "Sitting on Shoulders of Giants". Only this time the community is building the Giant ourselves. Growing it with each consecutive campaign. Campaign 1 **V²Site Launch** creates all the tools that makes working together as a community more focused and more efficient. In Campaign 2 we are already using these tools to full extend thus greatly increasing our speed by benefitting of automation. The new management tools also allow to add more contributors. We welcome the V²Shop-Midwest team: Karen, Tom and Bobby!


# Target of Campaign 2 {#target}

**Community Promotion Campaign:** V²Case has been developed with the Community. This is our opportunity to give back with Community discounts on ViCase and ViPC Trailblazer Products. Check out the innovative ViCase and ViPC products in the V²Shop. Help us promote the V² Shop by telling your friends to help us reach our stretch goal and you will earn free bonus products. The final goal of this campaign is to reach enough awareness to launch the Press & Shop Campaign 3.


# Preparing for Campaign 3 {#preparing}
The **Press and Shop** campaign is about gaining momentum of the V²Movement by the Press writing about V² Modular PC and regular Shops to carry V² Trailblazer Products ViCase and ViPC. But before they will get engaged we need to create enough visibility and grow our community large enough to be worth their while.
