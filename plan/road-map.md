# Detailed List of Campaigns {#detailed-list}

## Campaign 1

[V²Site Launch][1] is about creating the V² web site that publishes our vision, how we will get there, who we are and how this helps you. We also create the tools to make contribution very fast and easy. This helps us work faster and will attract more contributors to help V² move faster. Finally it gives you very easy methods to report bugs and request features via Article Issues and and in turn provides us with the tools to track, rate and close these issues very efficiently. Finally we create a Work Flow System that is guiding Contributors when working down their tasks and issues to deliver work so that it fits in directly without lengthy reworks.


## Connection 1-2

You have heard of “Sitting on Shoulders of Giants”. Only this time the community is building the Giant ourselves. Growing it with each consecutive campaign. Campaign 1 V²Site Launch creates all the tools that makes working together as a community more focused and more efficient. In Campaign 2 we are already using these tools to full extend thus greatly increasing our speed by benefitting of automation. The new management tools also allow to add more contributors. We welcome the V²Shop-Midwest team: Karen, Tom and Bobby!


## Campaign 2

[Community Promotion][2]: V²Case has been developed with the Community. This is our opportunity to give back with Community discounts on the V² Trailblazer Products ViCase and ViPC. Check out these innovative products in the V²Shop. Help us promote the V² Shop by telling your friends in order to help us reach our stretch goal and you will earn free bonus products.

## Connection 2-3
Campaign 3 Press and Shop is about gaining momentum of the V²Movement by the Press writing about V² Modular PC and regular Shops to carry the V² Trailblazer Products ViCase and ViPC. But before they will get engaged we need to create enough visibility and grow our community large enough to be worth their while.


## Campaign 3

[Press & Shop][3] Ready build Mini and All-In-One PCs are becoming available in major stores, such as Amazon, Newegg and eBay. Or if you are (or want to be) a shop owner we have tutorials and case studies on how to add ViCase or ViPC to your existing store or even how to build one. With ViPC shipping and the OEM campaign coming the V² Movement with its V² Trailblazer Products gets noticed by the press and write press releases, news stories and product reviews.

## Connection 3-4
The Press & Shop Campaign is lasting 

## Campaign 4
**V²Case Tiny** shrinks all the goodness of ViCase / ViPC to three Liters, effectively making the first ultra portable modular Workstation PC build from Desktop Parts. This campaign is about shipping the first Golden Samples, getting community reviews, include the feedback into an improved shipping Trailblazer Product ViCase and ViPC.

OEMs have the power to make the V² Mini and All-In-One PCs mainstream; to put them into the shop around your corner. We will demo V² with working products on our OEM Asia Tour in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We expect V² OEM products to become available in 2018. We also have an "Open House" in Guangzhou for OEM developer to visit us and get answers to their questions.
