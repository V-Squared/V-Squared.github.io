# Where Road Map fits in {#fit-where}

Each Campaign is part of the Road Map leading our work towards True North. In the below Tree Diagram you can see how and where a campaign fits into the bigger picture:

- [V²Agile System](https://v-squared.github.io/plan/agile/) shows how each Task works towards True North via 7 Layer hierarchy
   - [True North Article](https://v-squared.github.io/plan/true-north/) (Vision)
     - **L1: True North:** Where we want to be
   - [Road Map Book](https://v-squared.github.io/plan/road-map/) (Lead the way)
     - **L2: Road Map:** How to reach True North via consecutive Campaigns
     - **L3: Campaign:** How each Campaign moves to True North via group of Milestones *← You are here*
     - **L4: Milestone:** How each Milestone is completed via a bucket of Issues
   - [Dashboard Article](https://v-squared.github.io/plan/dashboard/) (Organize our daily development)
     - **L5: Sprint:** What Issues to work down in this week.
     - **L6: Issue:** Group of Tasks to be worked down, guided by User Story.
     - **L7: Task:** Actual work to be completed.



# How Road Map Works {#how-it-works}

## The Big Journey Metaphor

Say you want to walk on foot from Germany to the Himalayas. This is a long journey that requires some planning. You will break the long journey into smaller parts. You may call them campaigns. Each *Campaign* begins where the previous one ended. To not loose overview you map them out in the *Road Map*. When travelling through wasteland with no orientation available you will look to the *True North Star* to find your way. Each campaign still covers a significant distance, so you set *Milestones* to have smaller, more manageable targets. And each milestone is further broken down in smaller targets for every week, which you call weekly *Sprints*.


## Agile with Road Map works exactly the same

With True North we describe where we want to be when our journey is done. The Road Map shows how to get there with consecutive Campaigns. This document is the Road Map, as it list each Campaign Target and how each campaign is connected to its predecessor and successor.

# Detailed List of Campaigns {#detailed-list}

## Campaign 1

[V²Site Launch][1] is about creating the V² web site that publishes our vision, how we will get there, who we are and how this helps you. We also create the tools to make contribution very fast and easy. This helps us work faster and will attract more contributors to help V² move faster. Finally it gives you very easy methods to report bugs and request features via Article Issues and and in turn provides us with the tools to track, rate and close these issues very efficiently. Finally we create a Work Flow System that is guiding Contributors when working down their tasks and issues to deliver work so that it fits in directly without lengthy reworks.


## Connection 1-2

You have heard of “Sitting on Shoulders of Giants”. Only this time the community is building the Giant ourselves. Growing it with each consecutive campaign. Campaign 1 V²Site Launch creates all the tools that makes working together as a community more focused and more efficient. In Campaign 2 we are already using these tools to full extend thus greatly increasing our speed by benefitting of automation. The new management tools also allow to add more contributors. We welcome the V²Shop-Midwest team: Karen, Tom and Bobby!


## Campaign 2

[Community Promotion][2]: V²Case has been developed with the Community. This is our opportunity to give back with Community discounts on the V² Trailblazer Products ViCase and ViPC. Check out these innovative products in the V²Shop. Help us promote the V² Shop by telling your friends in order to help us reach our stretch goal and you will earn free bonus products.


## Connection 2-3

Campaign 2 grew awarenes and availability of V² Trailblazer Products to the point to peak the interest of press and shops. Campaign 3 will actively approach them with press releases and new products. Having press write about and shops sell V² Trailblazer products will increase the brand awareness of V² Modular PC further, making it easier for anyone to find, use and buy V² Trailblazer Products.

## Campaign 3

[Press & Shop Campaign:][3] Ready build Mini and All-In-One PCs are becoming available in major stores, such as Amazon, Newegg and eBay. Or if you are (or want to be) a shop owner we have tutorials and case studies on how to add ViCase or ViPC to your existing store or even how to build one. With ViPC shipping and the OEM campaign coming the V² Movement with its V² Trailblazer Products gets noticed by the press and write press releases, news stories and product reviews.


## Connection 3-4

The Press & Shop Campaign is lasting for half a year. It's first major news is the availability of V² Trailblazer Products in major onine stores. But one major news can not carry for half a year. This is where the introduction for V²Case Tiny and V²Case Mini come in. They will add major news every two months in this period. And each new case will introduce several new ViPC computer, each spread out two weeks apart.


## Campaign 4

**V²Case Tiny** shrinks all the goodness of ViCase / ViPC to three Liters, effectively making the first ultra portable modular Workstation PC build from Desktop Parts. This campaign is about shipping the first Golden Samples, getting reviews, include the feedback into new and improved shipping Trailblazer Products ViCase and ViPC.


## Connection 4-5

We are in the middle of the Press and Shop campaign. Frequently introducing new products keeps us in the press and adds more and more interest to shops. V²Case Small follows in these foot steps.


## Campaign 5

**V²Case Small** is introducing the V² Modular PC to the High End Gaming consumer market. Its key feature is the support of the GTX 1080 gaming graphics card. This further expands the market share of V² Modular PC.


## Connection 5-6

OEM are about shipping PCs in quantities. The PC consumer market is significantly larger than the workstation PC market. The introduction of V²Case Small opens the V² Modular PC to the consumer market. An important step to be attractive to OEM when we exhibit at Computex Taipei.

## Campaign 6

**Computex Taipei** in June 2017 is the biggest computer show tailored to the OEM. In time to the show we will complete all V²Standards needed for any OEM to develop their own V² compatible Mini or All-In-One PC. All license agreements are ready to provide the necessary legal foundation to OEM. V²Case and V²PC will be the first community developed, open source Mini and All-In-One computer system. As such it comes with accessories that are compatible between differet computer models made by diferent brands. V² exhibits at computex, domonstrating available standards, cases, PC's and RDKs (Rapid Development Kits) to the press and to the industry.


## Connection 6-7

The target of V² Modular PC is to make them mainstream. That means they become low cost and available in the shop around your corner. OEM's have the power to do that. Exhibiting V² Modular PC at Computex got us a foot into the door to OEMs. The OEM Asia Tour will get us in front of marketing people and engineers of an OEM. They are the ones who will make OEM versions of V² Modular PC happen.

## Campaign 7

OEMs have the power to make the V² Mini and All-In-One PCs mainstream; to put them into the shop around your corner. We will demo V² with working products on our **OEM Asia Tour** in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. We will exhibit in major cities. OEM can book our visit to their site, reducing cost and interruptions to train their marketing people and engineers on V² Modular Mini PC. We will bring OEM RDK's for the engineers to start Rapid Development. We also offer an "Open House" in Guangzhou for OEM developer to visit us at any time in order to get answers to their questions directly from the people who created V² Open Modular PC.


## Connection 7-8

This is the transition period of V²Case to V²Dock. The introduction of V²Dock sees the end of the V²Case Trailblazer Products Grace Period. We will lift all copyright and registered designs from ViCase and ViPC, opening them completely to any form of 1:1 reproduction. This includes publication of the 3D files for the case. Anyone can now go ahead and CNC cut or 3D print an original V²Case.


## Campaign 8

**V²Dock** is introducing the world's first Open Source, Modular Docking Station. The ideal docking station or expansion to the V²Modular PC, Tablet PC or Notebook. Add powerul RAID or GPU cards to your small computer or connect power, displays, mouse, keyboard and accessories with just one cable when you return with your computer / tablet to your desk.
