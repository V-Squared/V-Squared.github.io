# Where Road Map fits in {#fit-where}

Each Campaign is part of the Road Map leading our work towards True North. In the below Tree Diagram you can see how and where a campaign fits into the bigger picture:

# How Road Map Works {#how-it-works}

## The Big Journey Metaphor

Say you want to walk on foot from Germany to the Himalayas. This is a long journey that requires some planning. You will break the long journey into smaller parts. You may call them campaigns. Each *Campaign* begins where the previous one ended. To not loose overview you map them out in the *Road Map*. When travelling through wasteland with no orientation available you will look to the *True North Star* to find your way. Each campaign still covers a significant distance, so you set *Milestones* to have smaller, more manageable targets. And each milestone is further broken down in smaller targets for every week, which you call weekly *Sprints*.


## Agile with Road Map works exactly the same

With True North we describe where we want to be when our journey is done. The Road Map shows how to get there with consecutive Campaigns. This document is the Road Map, as it list each Campaign Target and how each campaign is connected to its predecessor and successor.
