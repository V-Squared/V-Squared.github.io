- **Sprint Kick Off:** Sunday 8:30 pm Las Vegas Time, Monday 11:30 am China time
- **Daily Stand Up:** 8:30 pm Las Vegas time, 11:30 am China time
- **Sprint Review:** At the bottom of each completed weekly sprint. → [Example Sprint Review](#example-sprint-review)

## Agile Sprint is new to you

A very quick introduction goes like this:

### Sprint Kick Off Meeting

- **Update Messgae:** Scrum Master notifies Team Members once Sprints Overview and Scrum Boards are updated.
- **Study Weekly Sprints:** Every Team Member studies a) the updated → [Weekly Sprints Overview](#weekly-sprints-overview) and b) the updated → [Scrum Board V²](https://waffle.io/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io) and → [Scrum Board Production](https://waffle.io/V-Squared/v2-Production) to understand targets and issues for this and next two sprints
- **Sprint Review:** Discuss the results of Sprint Review. → [Example Sprint Review](#example-sprint-review)
- **Discuss Problems:** Every team member already read target of this weeks sprint and her / his assignments. Only problems need to be discussed.
- **First Stand Up Meeting:** Each developer presents last Friday's work and drags the work of today into *Developing* column.

 At the end of each Sprint the Srum Master cleans out the [Scrum Board](https://waffle.io/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io) and archives all completed issues

For a detailed understanding please refer to our article series of V²Plan System / V²Plan Agile. 

### Daily Stand Up Meeting
At the beginning (or end) of every work day the sprint team meets for the Daily Stand Up Meeting. Each developer has 2 minutes to show what he did since the last meeting and what he is going to do until the next one. The idea is to synchronize order in which tasks are worked down to avoid one incompleted issue is gating another. This is also the best place to ask for help if needed. During the meeting the agreed upon next work is dragged from the *This Sprint* column to the *Developing* column.

### Working Down Issues
Every day each developer works down the issues assigned to him and placed in the *Developing* column of the [Scrum Board](https://waffle.io/V-Squared/V-Squared.github.io). In case he finishes early he drags another issue from *This Sprint* to *Developing* and works it down.

#### Statistics {#statistics}

{:.uk-table.uk-table-hover.uk-table-striped.table-detail}

| What | Number |
|------:|:--------------------|
| Total Number of Issues & Epics | 18 |
| Number of Epics | 2 |
| Number of Issues considering Epic Size (*1) | 32 |
| Number of Issues closed by V²Core | 32 |
| Number of Issues closed by V²Shop-Midwest (*2) | 0 |


- (*1) One Epic contains the in average work of 8 Normal Issues. 
- (*2) This number is misleading. V²Shop-Midwest worked on many Articles. But the Issue not closed yet. We should discuss to a) change these Issues to Epics, b) if we should break the Epic into separate issues for more transparent Management?
