# About Agile User Story Format

In *product development* a *user story* is a description from the user point of view. We use the *user story template*: "As a <role>, I want <goal/desire> so that <benefit>". V² services three user types: the *computer user*, the *computer manufacturer* and the *compuer retailer*. Consequently we deliver thre user stories, one for each user type.

# User Stories

## Open Modular Mini PC {#vision-modular-pc}

### Workstation User

As a **Workstation User** **I want:** a Mini PC that is as powerful as a workstation PC. It is build from standard desktop components. This makes custom building the workstation matching my requirements low cost. During the life time of the workstation it is easy to upgrade bottle neck parts. Even fixing the workstation is easy by isolating and replacing the defective part, leading to short repair times. The workstation is quiet, important for a relaxed working environment. The small size opens up completely new use cases: when needed it is convenient to take my workstation from my work desk to my home or to my customer. Placing the PC on top of the table makes wiring easy and access to the PC very comfortable. The integrated EMI filter and surge protection increases reliability. The added USB ports and power distribution removed the cable and adapter mess. 

**My benefits are** Significant cost savings, more comfortable working, cleaner work desk, increased productivity and increased service life.
