   The mission of V² is expressed in **V² True North**: A list of *User Stories* for each Product Line / Service / Standards of V². Each group of user stories contains views of *User*, *Manufacturer* and *Retailer*. These *User Stories* show them where we are going and guides the contributor to get there. As always you can provide feedback and contributions via *V²Flow Button*.

# Where True North fits in {#fit-where}

True North is our vision which we are working towards. To not get lost in the middle we created the V²Agile System. In the below Tree Diagram you can see how and where True North fits in:

- [V²Agile System](https://v-squared.github.io/plan/agile/) shows how each task works towards True North via 7 Layer hierarchy:

# Mission

## Making Missing Mini PC Standard Mainstream

Our mission is to develop, publish, promote and maintain all missing standards to enable anyone to develop, make, assemble, use and maintain Mini and All-In-One Computer. To lower any entry barriers, to reduce cost, to reduce trial and error in development and assembly.

At V² we are a global community of architects, thinkers, engineers and marketeers working together to achieve our vision of an Open Modular Mini or All-in-One PC Standard. We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential for individual and collective growths.

## Analogy to ATX Desktop PC Standard

Desktop ATX Computer were the best selling PC form factor, because the ATX standard made them to be lowest cost, fastest to develop, easiest to build and upgrade. But this de facto standard is 30 years old and was never updated to fit the needs of Mini and All-In-One Form Factor. The V² Standard fills this hole. By using the exact same principles that the ATX standard used on Deskopt PCs, the V² Standard is lowering cost, increasing development speed and performance and simplifies upgrading. In doing so V² is breathing new life into Mini and All-In-One PCs.


# Manifesto

These are the principles that guide our mission to promote openness, innovation & opportunity in computer design, making and using.


## Open Source

We will publish all knowledge, specifications, standards and design as open source. We will use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in development and publish all files in file formats compatible with FOSS.

## Zero Cost License

All V² licenses are and always will be at zero cost to the licensee.

## Trailblazer Products

During development of a new standard corresponding trailblazer products are deveoped in parallel to verify and demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of the new standard. During the spreading period they serve early adapters, press and developers as bleeding edge products and rapid development kits. During this period they also serve V² as our funding. After the spreading period their design is published as Open Source.

## Easy Contribution

We will provide a system that makes contribution easy and accessible to everyone.

## Community Quality Management

Quality management is very important. Specifications and test procedures are published in Open Source. Anyone can perform independant Quality Assrance Tests or provide such services to the community. We will provide a public data base as a central place to publish such test results.

## Community Driven Features

Any initial draft of specs or features are drawn up by community members and are published open source early on. Anyone in the community can make improvements.

## Agile Development

All deveopment of specs, standards, test procedures, trailblazer products, electronic design, mechanical design and artwork are developed using the Agile Development System.

## Public Road Map



## Gating Free

All work that we publish must be free of any kind of gating items or processes. Examples of gating items to avoid: Single source components, mandatory agency approval, etc.

## Discrimination Free

Everyone must have full access to all materials. License agreement can not single out certain licensees. All license agreements only require the agreement of the licensee.

## Modular Design



## Full Time Core Team

## Eating our own Dogfood



# Benefits

## Reduce Cost

Today Mini and All-In-One PCs are significantly more expensive than an ATX Desktop PC with identical specs. After V² becomes mainstream the cost of Mini and All-In-One PCs will be identical to a Desktop ATX PC with identical specs.

## Save Planet

Computer waste with all their hazardeous materials is one of the ecological problems of our planet. The modular nature of V² PCs allows the user to replace the broken or bottle neck part to extend the service life. By trashing only few parts versus the entire PC waste is reduced.
