# Magic of Markdown

## Staying in the Zone

## Markdown vs Markup

## Markdown Dialects

### Original Markdown

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

### Kramdown

# Quick Reference Below

Most of times a quick reference is all you need. And as the name promises, it is much faster than the full reference. In this spirit you will find below each kramdown element explained in 3 steps:

1. Story
3. Example

Only sometimes you will need more deytails, which you can find in the → [kramdown Syntax](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html).


# Headings

## Giving an Outline

When writing long text you will need to structure it in order to not get lost and to navigate it. This job is done by the heading. Navigation is accomplished by repeating the headings in the table of content and linking them to the occurrence in the text. The table of contents to the right is such an example. Click on an entry and the page will scroll to it.

## We only use 3 Levels

```
# Heading 1

This is the biggest and highest level. This is the admiral of headings.

## Heading 2

Almost as important. The captain of headings.

### Heading 3

This is still way more important than a paragraph, yet no longer important enough to be listed in the table of contents in our default setting of 2 levels. We chose this setting after consulting our readers revealed that 3 or more levels are too detailed and one level only was too coarse.
```
And below this is how above source code renders. ??? Note: On final publishing this part need to be removed from the TOC ???

# Lists

## Structure your Info

You get two types of lists to structure your information:

- Unordered list (Such as this one, each line item is equal).
- Ordered list (Recognizable by enumeration)

## Examples

```
__Shopping List:__

- Dairy products
  - Cheese
  - Milk
  - Yoghurt
  - Ice Cream
- Meat
  - Steak
    - Sirloin
    - Filet
  - Ground Meat

__Reading this Article:__

1. Read it top to bottom
2. Read it again and scratch your head: "What were they smoking?"
3. If you need to read a third time, then curse!
