subtitle: Missing Manual to the Markdown Editor Classeur
abstract: >
  Classeur is a wonderful markdown editor that we are using to write production ready articles for V²Flow.Publishing. Unfortunately it lacks a manual. This Classeur Mannual is our contribution to the Classeur community and our attempt to remedy this problem. As always, this article is open to anyone. Click the V²Flow button, next click "Edit Article", make changes and commit.

# Setting Up Classeur

## Top Level Settings






# Remaining Mysteries

## Export Pandoc TOC
I found no way to export the TOC. Since we need to export the ToC, this would have been useful. We are now using HTML export and manually copy paste the ToC from the HTML source. A bit crude and a pain to describe in a manual, but works.

# Modes

## Zen Mode

### What is Zen Mode

Zen is about you being in the *Zone* as in writing so focused that you forget anything else but your writing. Classeur assists you in entering the *Zone* via the *Zen Mode* which will fade the Classeur UI so all what is left for you to see: Is your writing!

### How to turn on Zen Mode:

1.Click Menu, enable the "Zen Mode" button 
2. Turn off Side Preview (if it is on, Zen Mode is disabled)
3. Turn off Side Bar (if it is on, Zen Mode is disabled)
4. Start typing without using the mouse
5. Wait for 5 seconds (during which you can type or not after you began typing)
6. Zen Mode will turn on automatically, by fading out the UI

### Limitations

I am using Classeur over any other text editor because I need the productivity of Live Preview and Live Table of Contents when typing markdown. Ironically turning on these functions turns off Zen Mode. I am contacting the authors to learn if I may have misunderstood the concept or if they will enable Zen Mode during writing with Preview / ToC enabled?
