# Using this Manual

## User Manual Style

This manual is structured in the order a new user will explore and use Classeur:

1. Familiarizing
2. Setting Up
3. Managing Documents
4. Writing
5. Publishing

# Familiarizing

## Strengths

Many authors find writing in markdown more productive than using other authoring tools. Classeur is a powerful markdown writing environment with integrated preview, collaboration and publishing. It works in browser and as such is cross platform. It is still in development, but we found it good enough for production and frankly we have not found an alternative. It lacks documentation, which is what we are trying to fix here.

| Setting | Description & Recommendation |
|--------:|:-----------------------------|
| Zoom | Global font size for all Classeur Windows. 
| Side Preview | Real time "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG). Most useful. |
| Side Bar | A third pane right to *Side Preview* offering 4 options: Help, Table of Contents (ToC), Discussions, History |
| Status Bar | Delivers documents statistics. We turn it on when needed and off otherwise for benefit of more writing space. |
| Button Bar | Quasi WYSIWYG formatting toolbar. Very useful to beginners. |
| Zen Mode | Dims the UI to let you focus during writing. → [Zen Mode](#zen-mode).|
| Scroll Sync | Synchronizes scrolling of preview pane with the writing pane. If you use *Side Preview* you will want this one to be on! |


# Writing

## Markdown Intro

Classeur is a markdown editor. If you are not familiar with markdown you will want to read its introduction article → ???

## Zen Mode

### Benefits of Zen Mode

Zen is about you being in the *Zone* as in writing so focused that you forget anything else but your writing. Classeur assists you in entering the *Zone* via the *Zen Mode* which will fade the Classeur UI so all what is left for you to see: Is your writing!

### Turning on Zen Mode:

1.Click Menu, enable the "Zen Mode" button 
2. Turn off Side Preview (if it is on, Zen Mode is disabled)
3. Turn off Side Bar (if it is on, Zen Mode is disabled)
4. Start typing without using the mouse
5. Wait for 5 seconds (during which you can type or not after you began typing)
6. Zen Mode will turn on automatically, by fading out the UI

### Limitations

I am using Classeur over any other text editor because I need the productivity of Live Preview and Live Table of Contents when typing markdown. Ironically turning on these functions turns off Zen Mode. I am contacting the authors to learn if I may have misunderstood the concept or if they will enable Zen Mode during writing with Preview / ToC enabled?

# Publishing

## Publishing Power

Publishing workflows vary wildly. Classeur is very flexible in this regard. It supports a large verity of publishing platforms and data formats.

__Integrated direct upload:__

- Blogger
- Dropbox
- GitHub
- Tumblr
- WordPress
- Any other publishing platform via copy and paste.

__Export Data Formats:__

- Markdown
- HTML (plain & styled)
- PDF
- RTF
- OpenOffice / LibreOffice
- Word
- EPUB
- LaTex
- And many more through [PanDoc](http://pandoc.org/).

As such it also gives you enough rope to hang yourself. There are simply too many possible workflows to document them all here. Instead we are documenting but one, in the hope that you can use above list of capabilities in combination with the fully described workflow below to create your own publishing workflow.

__Note:__ You should be able to use most of the workflow for your purposes. E.g. it is likely that your publishing system will require a Table of Contents. We show you how to create in the most common formats: HTML, JSON and YAML. We also show you how to link Classeur to GitHub. Once you see how you can link one platform it shall be easy to link to the others.

If you have documented your workflow and like to share it help others than use the V²Flow button to create a fork of this article, add  your workflow and make a pull request so to share it with others.

## GitHub Pages Publishing

## Create ToC

### Export HTML ToC

### HTML ToC → YAML or JSON

### Add ToC to Front Matter 

## Push to GitHub

## Connect to GitHub



# Remaining Mysteries

## Export Pandoc TOC
I found no way to export the TOC. Since we need to export the ToC, this would have been useful. We are now using HTML export and manually copy paste the ToC from the HTML source. A bit crude and a pain to describe in a manual, but works.

# Modes




# Improvement Ideas

## Setup Classeur

- Sections to get titles: This way is easier to refer to a section in the manual
- 

# Sort In

Automatic ToC

- Write in Classeur Manual how to limit ToC to 2 Levels
   - http://classeur.io/help/extensions/
- Automatic Table of Contents Generation #130


Report to Classeur

- Life ToC also respect heading depth
- Create simple document H1, H2, H3 to reproduce
- Show how configured ToC
