# Intro V².Flow.Publishing

## Speed

We are a small team. Speed allows us to get more things done. V²Flow.Publishing is build for speed. No matter if you are looking at learning curve or the time to go through workflows of writing, publishing and contribution.

## Joy

{emo.joy}

Writing and publishing is creative work. When you enjoy it your work automatically moves smoother and the quality and creativity simply goes up. We needed writing and publishing workflows and tools that get out of the way. So the writer can get into the zone and stay there without being ripped out by non intuitive tools and workflows.

## Clarity

{emo.clarity}

Lack of clarity was our single biggest impediment to speed. When we set out building a new publishing system from scratch we made it a point for its workflows to be simple and clear. For its documentation to be a model of clarity. In the end you can't help it that clarity of your own writing will improve too!

## Contribution Friendly

{emo.community}

We believe in community development. We equipped V²Flow.Publishing with a very easy contribution system. For the visitor it is fast and straight forward to make changes. For the staff it is very fast to incorporate them. 

## Open and Free

{emo.free}

Our organization is part of the Open Source Movement. Consequently we want to use best of breed, bleeding edge technologies, apps and services. We found they work great. And if they don't we can work with their active and responsive communities to fix the problems. We are on GitHub and we comprised V².Flow.Publishing of tools, apps and services that are on GitHub too.

## Technical Benefits

For whom above chapters was too much prose here come the hardcore benefits:

1. Very efficient workflows for: Writing, publishing, contribution. Making us 3x faster.
2. Great documentation: Detailed references and tutorials with templates for fast and easy training.
3. High quality Responsive Design † automatically making the best of every screen size.
4. Enabling our team to produce the best looking know how articles with best flow and clearest structure.
5. We have full control on design and styling.
6. Low cost. Ideally hosting, templates and plugins are all free.
7. We  do not loose time solving conflicts after updating plugins and extension (Joomla)
8. If possible all ingredients are FOSS

† Responsive design means that the page layout and content automatically to the screen size of the device you are using. We require that for mobile support all features remain intact. Reader keeps overview despite the small screen. UI is fast. despite the less performance of mobile devices. And for big screen the responsive design puts the added real estate is put to good use.


## Who is this Article Series for?

Any single person, team or organization who wish to increase quality of writing, styling and structure of articles. And at the same time dramatically increase the speed to get the work done.

For V² Senior Editors, Writers, Producers and Publishers this article series is a must read. For junior staff and contributing writers these articles are optional. 

If you are managing a team of writers and publishers in a place without documented style guides and workflows this article series could be your nirvana.

# Understanding Change

 Our goal is efficient and effective writing, publication and contribution. Achieving this in the past we simple by applying industry accepted style guides and workflows. We found out that this holds no longer true, as the industry is changing faster than style guides and workflows follow suit. 
 
 In this section we will show just how much publishing has changed in the last 20 years with the pace of changes ever increasing. We deduce the consequences and the need for a completely new 

## Limit of old days was Content

When I was young the biggest event in my life was the yearly computer show. We arrived with empty bags and left with as much brochures and catalogues as we could carry: hundreds of them. Within a month I read through them completely cover to cover. The remaining 11 months was waiting for the next show and reading the monthly computer magazines, which kept me busy a few days per months. In other words: Most of time I was hungrily waiting for content.

Most style guides have been created in — or at the very least are heavily influenced by — the era of print media. In that era space was really expensive. For two reasons:

__Distribution Cost *WAS* expensive:__

If you wonder why that is than remember the costs of printing and sharing content:

1. __Printing Costs:__ 
    1. A single sheet double page brochure project was > $ 1,000 US. Print quantity almost did not matter.
3. __Sharing Costs:__
    1. A mailing list project to 3000 customers was > $ 6,000 US.
    2. 4th cover page on MacWorld Germany with a reach of 50,000 readers was about $ 5,000 US
    3. Fair sized booth on a computer show to spread your brochures: > $ 10,000 US


## Reader's Time is new Limit

Today we are not waiting for content at all. There is more content available on the internet than we could read in a thousand life time. I wager that even narrowed down to what one person is interested in there is still more available than he could read in his lifetime. With more content showing up every day. Google makes it easy to find the best suitable content and mobile and tablet devices allows reading in all places and circumstances. Yet we do not have enough time to read it all.

__Distribution costs today are irrelevant__

## Writer's time is other new Limit

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| Ratio † | Year | Yearly Cost | Medium                                         | Limit |
|:-------:|:----:|------------:|:-----------------------------------------------|:-----:|
|   1%    | 1993 |  $ 60,000   | Brochures and Advertisements                   | Cost  |
|   5%    | 1996 | $ 300,000   | Brochures, Advertisements, Web Site, Shows     | Cost  |
|   5%    | 2002 |  $ 20,000   | Web Site, Shows                                | Time  |
|  90%    | 2016 |  $  1,000   | GitHub Pages ‡, GitHub Issues & Google Adwords | Time  |

† Ratio of my written text versus published text. In the early years my bulk of text were personal notes and emails.
‡ GitHub Pages is a website hosting service based on a kramdown publishing workflow.

The numbers in above tables are statistics from Village Tronic. It is a small computer company that produced graphics cards and docking stations. I believe the numbers are representative in terms of demonstrating two turning points:

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| Year |   Turning Point    | Medium / Technology Change |
|:----:|:------------------:|:---------------------|
| 2002 | Cost to Time Limit | Replacing advertisement and shows in magazines with the website |
| 2016 | Move all to GitHub | __1)__ Writing in Kramdown is much faster than in HTML<br>__2)__ Switch communication from email to GitHub Issues (100% public)<br>__3)__ Switch from proprietary to Open Source |


## Mobile Support

__Mobile Usage__

How many percent of our readers use mobile to read our web site:

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| Year |   %   | Comments                                           |
|:----:|------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
| 2006 |    0% | No demand whatsoever                               |
| 2014 |   10% | Complaints about poor mobile support               |
| 2016 | > 50% | Compliments on mobile support. Share still growing |

These numbers speak for themselves: Without good mobile support we would loose half of our reader's time. 

__How it Works__
In order to deliver a quality mobile phone experience for a developer web site we needed to develop our own template and publication tools. This was a huge effort. Now that it is mostly done the writer enjoys that mobile support is completely transparent to him. In other words: The author writes in kramdown, only focusing on content. Our template and publishing engine takes care of the nitty gritty details to format content differently according the screen size the user is using.

## Dramatically Increased Contribution

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| Year |     Frequency         | How to get Contribution   | Time to Implement |
|:----:|:---------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1993 |   Few times per Year  | On computer shows         | Weeks             |
| 2010 |   Few times per week  |          Facebook         | Hours to Days     |
| 2016 | Several times per day | GitHub Issues & V² Flow   | Minutes           |


## What does this all mean?

__Need for new Style Guides__
We scoured the internet and did not find a modern style that has taken into account all above changes. As such we are now developing one.

__Need for a new workflows__
In order to achieve the benefits and features we were looking for we needed to let go of the trusted HTML centric workflow and create a new series of workflows centered around kramdown. We even needed to create a corresponding new mashup of apps, services, and template. This big one time effort paid off, when the new kramdown workflow started working, see below:

__Kramdown Publishing Works__
This is our third attempt to create efficient and effective writing and publishing workflows. This time it really worked. We reduced costs, increased speed and increased contribution. Our new website looks clean and modern and works on all screen sizes.


# Modern Formats

## V² Reader's Survey

We asked our readers what format they wanted to see our new website to support:

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| How many need |  Reader's Requested Document Format |
|:---:|:-------------------------------------|
| 70% | __Mobile Phone & Tablet:__ All features usable. Legibility remains high. Fast to use. |
| 60% | __Desktop PC with Big Screen:__ Increased usability by making use of extra space. |
| 10% | Optional PDF documents for our standard section only. Used for offline reading and filing away for reference. |

**Note:** Each reader could tick all offered formats. As such each format can range from 0% ... 100%.

## V² Author's Survey

We asked our authors & editors what formats they want us to support natively:

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

| Feature | Usage |
|--------:|:------|
| Markdown | Once a writer starts using markdown, he typically uses it during his entire writing workflow from beginning to end. It is compatible to all writing tools, enabling the author to keep using his favorite apps. |
| GFM | GitHub Flavored Markdown is used in GitHub issues. Once you learned to master its power, you want to keep using it during the writing workflow. |
| Kramdown Input | It has significant feature upgrades over GFM. Without these publishing a web site would be crippled. |
| HTML Input | Occasionally even Kramdown can not do everything. HTML extends the capabilities sufficiently. Kramdown is powerful enough that only sparingly we need to fall back to HTML. |
| Kramdown & HTML Output | One of our targets is that our articles are quoted or copied with attribution to V²Site. Availability of our articles in both kramdown and HTML will simplify republishing. HTML code need to be of high quality to allow easy styling by third party sites.|
| PDF Output | Especially for standards our readers have requested PDF version of the standard article for two reasons: 1) To read them offline 2) To archive them.


# Modern Publishing

## Kramdown to the Rescue

We tried both Google Drive and Joomla to develop a workflow that somehow supports all file formats as requested by the V² reader and writer and the same time is fast and fun to use. We tried hard and failed. What you see now is our third attempt, which is successful. The key ingredient to make it happen is *Kramdown*. We describe its use and central function in this section:


## Kramdown Overview

For those not familiar with kramdown, it is a super set of markdown by supporting:

- [Original Markdownl](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) Easy to read and write markup language.
- [GFM aka GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) GitHub added features to reference people, issues and commits. 
- [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) It adds important features lacking in Markdown.

![Kramdown Overview](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/overview.png)

As you can see in the info-graphics above: All requested formats are available in all respective directions. The table below explains this in more details:

{:.uk-table.twin-head.twin-blue}

|       Format | Dir | Workflow Stage, Purpose & Benefit |
|-------------:|:---:|:----------------------------------|
| Markdown | ➜☐ | __Stage:__ Creation<br>__Purpose:__ Brainstorming, Creating Outline<br>__Benefit:__ Compatible with any writing and management app. Magic of markdown.|
| GFM † | ➜☐ | __Stages:__ Creation, Develop, Beta<br>__Purpose:__ GFM † → GitHub Flavored Markdown, used in GitHub Issues.<br>__Benefits:__ Rich discussions with powerful referencing. |
| HTML | ➜☐ |  __Stages:__ Develop <br>__Purpose:__ Add features Kramdown lacks.<br>__Benefits:__ No need to give up features. |
| Kramdown | ➜☐ |  __Stages:__ Develop, Beta, Make <br>__Purpose:__ Markup language used to structure our articles. <br>__Benefits:__ Much faster and easier to write and edit than HTML. |
| Kramdown | ☐➜ |  __Stages:__ Develop, Beta, Make <br>__Purpose:__ Output of writing. Input to Jekyll / GitHub Pages. <br>__Benefits:__ Much faster and easier to edit than HTML. |
| PDF | ☐➜ |  __Stages:__ Make <br>__Purpose:__ Give developers piece of mind in the standard section. <br>__Benefits:__ Developers are used to standard documents being PDF files. They want to have the standard tucked away on their drive for permanent reference. |
| HTML | ☐➜ |  __Stages:__ Make <br>__Purpose:__ Export HTML for purpose of re-publishing on other sites. <br>__Benefits:__ Be compliant to the standardized HTML workflow.  |

__What's in the Box?__
In above diagram and table we symbolized input as: ➜☐ and output as: ☐➜. The box after or before the arrow symbolizes the Kramdown publishing process. Two tools are used: The kramdown compatible editor: *Classeur* and the *Kramdown* aware *V²Site* publishing engine, which is based on GitHub Pages, Jekyll, Liquid, our custom V²Template and our custom AngularJS code.

__How is the quality of the source code?__
One one word: __Great!__ As for kramdown source code it is as good as your style. That said, kramdown does not give you much rope to hang yourself. And in terms of HTML generated from kramdown it is as good as hand coded and optimized HTML. Easy and clean to apply styles or do further manual edits.

 
## Kramdown vs Alternatives

__Kramdown vs HTML Publishing__

When publishing HTML documents nowadays you would be using a Content Management System (CMS) such as Wordpress, Joomla, or Dropal. We published for a long time in Joomla. Joomla has a very nice feature *Front End Editing*. What it does is that after logging in you can browse the web site just like any visitor. But when you find a spot to improve you click the front end edit button and you are right in the HTML article. 

This is great, except that for the important fact that our richly formatted articles are made of significantly more HTML markup than *Copy*. In other words: You are spending a lot of time to find the place to edit. 

In comparison on V²Site we also have the front end edit button as part of the *V²Flow* button. We publish our articles directly in kramdown source code. That means 90% is copy and only 10% is markup. In other words: Editing is fast and fluid. 

As a consequence we walked away from HTML publishing to Kramdown Publishing.

__Kramdown vs Google Docs__

We hosted our developer site on Google Docs for quite a while. It was a mixed blessing. We thoroughly enjoyed its innovative features such as simultaneously edit a document with various editors or its simplicity of use. One of the purposes of our developer site was to develop content for our web site. No matter how hard we tried we could not create an effective workflow to export quality HTML with space efficient graphics from Google Drive. Another problem was the lack of applying a consistent style sheet to all documents. In addition it lacked full support of responsive design or backup options. 

As a consequence we walked away from Google Docs Publishing towards Kramdown Publishing.

__Kramdown vs WYSIWYG tools__

There are three big advantages that stand out:

__1) Stay in the zone:__ Once you are used to write in markdown you will be more focused when writing versus using a WYSIWYG editor where you need to use keyboard short cuts or mouse clicks to apply your formatting. Somehow it is like constantly shifting gears, ripping you out of the flow. Whereas when typing in markdown you will only feel a constant uninterrupted flow of writing. 

__2) Less conflicts / faster debugging:__ You may think that working with source code nowadays is antiquated. But the fact is that when you build a complex web site you will have conflicts. And when resolving conflicts you will have to look at the source code anyway. Debugging goes much easier when you work with clean and slender handwritten source code versus garbled and convoluted source code from a WYSIWYG editor. 

And we have much less conflicts since working with hand written kramdown vs HTML generated by the WYSIWYG editor of Joomla.

__3) Markdown is coming:__ Twitter, WordPress and GitHub all use Markdown. It simply jives with the writer's / programmer's mindset.



# Conclusion

## Unlearn Traditional Style Guides

You must forget style guides for print. They are concerned about reducing the distribution limit for the writer and at the same time the available content limit for the reader by means of creating a more compact layout. Since this served both writer and reader the traditional style guides made sense for everyone and were widely accepted. But it no holds true in a time for publishing cost is zero and the reader is overwhelmed with great content.

## The New Style Guide

The new era of free publishing cost and overwhelming amount of content needs new style guides that focus on reducing the reading cost. Reading cost is how fast a reader can scan a document or navigate it. How fast can he ingest its content? How well is it written, how clear is it structured?

We searched yet have not found one new style guide ready for modern writing and publishing. As such part of this article series are new style guides, templates and preflight checks adjusted to the new era.

## The New Publishing Flow

The new publishing flow switches from HTML centric to Kramdown. As a consequence writer, editor and contributor work in one language only. Kramdown is significantly easier to read and edit than HTML. Even a contributor not being aware of HTML or Kramdown will be capable of editing a kramdown source file by simply looking at it and apply common sense.

Combine this with the custom template and mashup of V²Site and V²Flow you end up with more speed, ease of use and more involvement by your community. Last but not least work is more intuitive and fun, which leads to increased productivity and creativity.

## Complete Solution

V²Flow.Publishing is a complete solution, covering the entire ground from understanding, style guides, workflow, references, documentation, templates and preflight checks including tutorials on how to use key apps.

## Grand Conclusion

The last decade saw dramatic changes in the publishing and computer industry which invalidated long standing and proven style guides and workflows.

V²Flow.Publishing starts with a clean slate. It provides updated style guides and workflows matching the requirements of the new era. It comes with complete and consistent documentation to easy the learning curve, or respectively reducing the workload of the senior staff when training junior staff.

By switching from HTML centric workflow to kramdown writer, editor and contributor enjoy the increased legibility and simplicity of edits as well as staying in the zone of writing.

Last but not least article templates, workflow templates and preflight checks speed up work and help to keep quality on a consistent high level.
