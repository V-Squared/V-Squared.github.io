  *Workflows* and *Task-templates* on CAD - CAM - CNC
abstract: >
  We started CAD in-house design in 2008. In-house CAM and CNC followed in 2014. We saved a lot of time by learning from tutorials and workflow published by the community. This is our effort to give back to the community via publishing workflows and tutorials that we developed in those instances we could not find them already made. There is a second reason: We plan to eventually release all ViCase mechanical design files completely as Open Source under CC-License to the community. By publishing early on which software packages, formats, and workflows we choose, the community can get involved so we all can come to a consensus of best choices and practices. So by the time we will release the design files they are most useful to the community. Early on feedback by the community will hopefully help us to  increase efficiency, lowering cost and lead time of ViCase Trailblazer Production.
