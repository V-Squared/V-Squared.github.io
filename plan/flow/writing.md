title: Introduction on Writing Articles
subtitle: >
  *Style Guides* and *Task-Templates* on writing articles in high quality ready to be published on V². 
abstract: >
  A large group of Articles that are correctly cross referenced, nicely laid out, beautifully structured, richely illustrated and free of redundancy and errors are a joy to read. The correct integration into V² Flow invites community contribution and increases the value further. But creating this high quality was tedious and error-prone work. In this introduction we show how V² Flow simplifies the work for both writer and editor.
