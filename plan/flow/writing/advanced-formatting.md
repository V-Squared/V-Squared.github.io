# Advanced Table Formatting

## Example of a Comparison Table

{% include table id="table-vicase-vs-macpro" %}


## User Story
As a **Reader of your Comparison Review** I very appreciate the intuitive coloring of cell backgrounds: red = bad, yellow = so so , green = good. This speeds up my table reading significantly! And I can see pattern that otherwise I would have overlooked. These pattern proved most helpful in my decision making process.

## More Complex Example

{% include table id="table-comparison-all" %}
