title: Workflow from CAD to CAM to CNC
subtitle: Workflow and Tutorial to turn your CAD design into a CNC cut part you can hold in your hands.
abstract: Creating the CNC files that you feed to the CNC machine is not nearly as clear cut as you would expect. (Pun intended). Instead it is a creative process similar to creating the CAD file of your design. As always many ways lead to Rome and your mileage will vary. That being said, following this guide you will find Rome. You will get their with no detours. And you will get there in time yet travelling economy class.
