title: V²Agile Workflow on GitHub
subtitle: Getting Started 1&#58; All Steps from Vision to Ideas through Sprint Development to Product Release.
abstract: Agile development requires the repeated precise execution of specific workflows. V²Plan tools are designed to guide and assist in executing these workflows. This Article first shows the Overview Agile Workflow from beginning to end. Then you can zoom into each step of the overview which is a complete workflow in on itself. Each workflow is documented with three methods&#58; <strong>1)</strong> User Stories, <strong>2)</strong> Step by Step Text Tutorial, <strong>3)</strong> Video Tutorial. Interactive Info-graphics assist in the learning process. Whereas the → Agile Development Primer focus on the principles of Agile Development, these workflows focus on their implementation in daily work.

# Introduction
This is the User Manual V²Agile which is our complete *Development Process* from *Ideas* to *Shippable Product* or *Product Increment*. We are using the *Agile Rapid Development Methodology*. It is how we bring the V²Plan into reality.

You will get a full overview by simply studying the *Infographics* above. You can hover (tab on tablet) onto the call outs to explore a balloon help with more information and a link to even more details.

This User Manual is written in a way to be an effective read for you independent if you are familiar with *Agile* or not. If you are, then you can quickly find the mapping to the *Tools*, *Plans* and exact *Workflows* that we use. If you are not familiar with Agile we will give you enough explanation that it all makes sense.

To fully implement what you are reading here you may need to study *V² Plan Reference* (??? URL to Article).

The key benefit to *Agile* is to have a *Shippable Product Increment* in a very short time frame, as short as 1 day, but typically 1 week ... 4 weeks.

If you are only familiar with the traditional *Waterfall Development Process* it is best that you forget everything that you know about it, as Agile is radically different. 


# (1) Input <a name="1"></a>
## Overview
Anyone is invited to provide Input as in *Bug Reports* or *Feature Requests* or general *Improvement Ideas*. Simply post an Issue in the *v2-Input* GitHub Repository.
## Details
1. Go → ??? URL to Issues of v2-Input Repositories
2. Search in the already posted issues of a similar issue already exist. 
   - If yes: Add a comment to add your specific ideas / concerns / bugs
   - If no: Create an issue. Give it a descriptive title. 
3. Wait for us to contact you with feedback to your *Issue* by writing a comment to your Issue with either further questions or updated status information on your Issue. GitHub will notify you with the *Blue Bell*. [→ Top](#top)

# (2) Sorting In <a name="2"></a>
## Overview
The *V² Product Owner* Hubert will sort in your Issue into 4 Priority Levels: 1) High 2) Medium 3) Low 4) Reject.

## Details
The *Sorting In* procedure in details:

1. **Accept or Reject:** Compare the *Issue* with *True North*. Does the Issue bring us closer to True North or is it a *Distraction*? Compare the effort of implementation versus the benefits to the Community.
   - **If Accept:** Update the *Status Information* with a  thank you note.
   - **If Reject:** Update the *Status Information* with an apology including the reason why we had to reject. Add an invitation if the *Issue Owner* knows a method to overcome our *Reason of Rejection* his very invited to let us know and we will have a second look.
2. **Which Repository:** Compare the spirit of the list of *V² Repositories* and pick the one which comes closest.
   - **High Priority:** Does the idea of this *Issue* solve a pressing *Issue*? Does it provide an idea on how to implement in a simple way an often requested *Feature*? Is it a *Low Hanging Fruit*? Are we working on a related *Issue* and squeezing this one in is easy now and hard later? If yes → then create a new Issue with same Title and content in a current Milestone and cross link with the original *Issue* in *v2-Input* Repository.
   - **Medium Priority:** It is a good idea, but not *High Priority*. → Create a new Issue with same Title and content in the Milestone *Med Priority* in the corresponding *Repository* and cross link with the original *Issue* in *v2-Input* *Repository*.
   - **Low Priority:** It is a good idea, but not relevant at this time. It has however a chance to become important at another time. → Create a new Issue with same Title and content in the Milestone *Low Priority* in the corresponding *Repository* and cross link with the original *Issue* in *v2-Input* *Repository*.
