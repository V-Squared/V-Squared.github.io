title: Solving Agile on GitHub Problems
subtitle: List of Problems of managing Agile Development and Production on GitHub to be cured by V²Plan System
abstract: >
   After switching to Agile Development on GitHub we were still left wanting. Although we cured a lot of problems ailing us, some of the old problems were not eradicated yet by using GitHub alone and even some new problems emerged. 
   
   This is our list of remaining problems and how V²Plan did already or is expected to cure them. This document is one of the guides for our V²Plan development. If you are evaluating V²Plan you can compare your problems with our list of Problems prior to V²Plan introduction. If you find similarities to your problems, chances are V²Plan is your solution too. As always you can ask questions, report bugs or request features with the orange V²Flow button.
