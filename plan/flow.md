title: Intro to V² Workflows
subtitle: >
  *How-to Guides* and *Task-Templates* on contributing work to V² efficiently in high quality.
abstract: >
  To make the V² Open Modular Mini PC Movement a success we need lots of high quality content. Common problems on creating a large body of work with many contributors are inconsistencies of all kinds. They frustrate the reader and eventually drive him away. V² Workflows is about solving this problem by means of V² Flow. A contributor early on enters Flow and from thereon Flow guides the contributor on what to do and on how to do it right in the first place. Saving the *Curators* of V² lots of rework.
