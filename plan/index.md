# Simple and Fast {#simple}

Editing an article, reporting a bug or provide an idea is all accessible with just one mouse click / tab on the V²Flow Button. The power of community editing has been proven by [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). V² applies this method (quite possibly for the first time) to standards and products.
