# Getting Started {#getting-started}

In the best spirit of Agile Development that puts experience over documentation you can dive straight into V²Plan with the four *Getting Started* Articles: → V²Agile Workflow on GitHub, → V²Sprint Workflow on GitHub, → Roles & Communication, → Testing.

## V²Agile Workflow on GitHub {#agile-workflow}

### Getting Started 1: All Steps from Vision to Ideas through Sprint Development to Product Release

Agile development requires the repeated precise execution of specific workflows. V²Plan tools are designed to guide and assist in executing these workflows. This Article first shows the *Overview Agile Workflow* from beginning to end. Then you can zoom into each step of the overview which is a complete workflow in on itself. Each workflow is documented with three methods: **1)** User Stories, **2)** Step by Step Text Tutorial, **3)** Video Tutorial. Interactive Info-graphics assist in the learning process. Whereas the → *Agile Development Primer* focus on the principles of Agile Development, these workflows focus on their implementation in daily work.

## Testing {#testing}

### Getting Started 4: How to frequently test, integrate and release a Shipable Product Increment.

Testing, integration and shipping need to be very efficient when you have to release the product once a week. Naturally solutions will be very specific to your type of product and development tools. Our products are Know How Articles and Web Applications. This Article shows how we solved the practical problems for us, how our Workflow looks like and what tools we are using.
