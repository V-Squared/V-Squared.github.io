# Discussion on License Choices

## Researching which License famous Open Source Initiatives are using

- [Open Source Initiative:](https://opensource.org/) CC-BY-4.0
- [Open Source Hardware Association:](http://www.oshwa.org/) CC-BY-SA-4.0
- [Creative Commons:](https://creativecommons.org) CC-BY-4.0
- [Arduino:](https://www.arduino.cc/) CC-BY-SA-4.0

## Discussion

- All of the above are Open Source Initiatives, with the exception of Arduino
- The majority of the Open Source Initiative use CC-BY-4.0
- If we were to go with using CC-BY-4.0 it will allow people using Arduino projects to incorporate our projects without license conflicts. We could only incorporate projects that are under CC-BY-4.0 or MIT and not under CC-BY-SA-4.0. For the scope of our projects, that is OK

## We are going with CC-BY-4.0, because

- It is the choice of similar Open Source Initiatives
- It requires licensees to attribute V², which is in the interest of the licensee and the V² Community
- It does not require the licensee to publish his derivative work (his products) in Open Source. Most commercial user would have a problem with that. Insisting on this would severely limit wide spread adoption of V² in the industry, which is not in the interest of V² Community, the industry nor the user.
- It has a very simple [human readable summary](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
   - This document is available in a lot of language. Nice service to our users.
- It has a [spelled out legal code](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)

## Why not MIT

Several of our contributors worried that under the very free MIT license work contributed to V² is allowed to be used to build the foundation of a competing standard which further more may be under a more restricted license. This is not in the spirit of V² where we want all missing and newly developed standards to remain free forever.
