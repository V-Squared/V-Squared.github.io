- __Story:__ A traditional All-in-One will always limit your choices for the display(s). The ViStand Modular All-in-One frees you to choose any display (4k, 120 Hz, IPS), including the one you already own. And, unlike with a traditional AiO, if your needs change, so can your monitor. Don't replace an entire computer when you just need to upgrade one component! || Visualization Idea: Each tab is one special display, with title & subtitle explaining its usefulness. The image simply showing ViStand + Display + Keyboard & Mouse. || Type = Tabs.
