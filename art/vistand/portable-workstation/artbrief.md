- __Story:__ There are moments where just portable is not enough. When you need the power of a desktop and the ergonomics of a big screen and a full sized keyboard. Yet you want portability too. Your notebook does not deliver, and your desktop chains you to the desk. Yet you want the productivity boost of portability, especially when working in teams. This is where the ViStand Portable Workstation is breaking new ground (or rather old ground, if you remember the first Mac). Let's get *Agile* and illustrate the point with a *User Story*: You just finished the new thing and are called to a meeting. You hibernate your portable workstation, drop your mouse into your pocket and park your keyboard in ViStand and then simply carry your workstation by its grip! When you arrive, plug in power, wake up your PC and place keyboard and mouse on the table. Within a minute you changed your location and are ready to continue on a full fledged workstation.
